.TH CURLOPT_UPLOAD 3 "17 Jun 2014" "libcurl 7.37.0" "curl_easy_setopt options"
.SH NAME
CURLOPT_UPLOAD \- enable data upload
.SH SYNOPSIS
#include <curl/curl.h>

CURLcode curl_easy_setopt(CURL *handle, CURLOPT_UPLOAD, long upload);
.SH DESCRIPTION
The long parameter \fIupload\fP set to 1 tells the library to prepare for and
perform an upload. The \fICURLOPT_READDATA(3)\fP and
\fICURLOPT_INFILESIZE(3)\fP or \fICURLOPT_INFILESIZE_LARGE(3)\fP options are
also interesting for uploads. If the protocol is HTTP, uploading means using
the PUT request unless you tell libcurl otherwise.

Using PUT with HTTP 1.1 implies the use of a "Expect: 100-continue" header.
You can disable this header with \fICURLOPT_HTTPHEADER(3)\fP as usual.

If you use PUT to a HTTP 1.1 server, you can upload data without knowing the
size before starting the transfer if you use chunked encoding. You enable this
by adding a header like "Transfer-Encoding: chunked" with
\fICURLOPT_HTTPHEADER(3)\fP. With HTTP 1.0 or without chunked transfer, you
must specify the size.
