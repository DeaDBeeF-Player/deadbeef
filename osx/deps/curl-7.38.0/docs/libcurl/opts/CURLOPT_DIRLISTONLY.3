.TH CURLOPT_DIRLISTONLY 3 "17 Jun 2014" "libcurl 7.37.0" "curl_easy_setopt options"
.SH NAME
CURLOPT_DIRLISTONLY \- ask for names only in a directory listing
.SH SYNOPSIS
#include <curl/curl.h>

CURLcode curl_easy_setopt(CURL *handle, CURLOPT_DIRLISTONLY, long listonly);
.SH DESCRIPTION
A parameter set to 1 tells the library to just list the names of files in a
directory, instead of doing a full directory listing that would include file
sizes, dates etc. This works for FTP and SFTP URLs.

This causes an FTP NLST command to be sent on an FTP server.  Beware that some
FTP servers list only files in their response to NLST; they might not include
subdirectories and symbolic links.

Setting this option to 1 also implies a directory listing even if the URL
doesn't end with a slash, which otherwise is necessary.

Do NOT use this option if you also use \fICURLOPT_WILDCARDMATCH(3)\fP as it
will effectively break that feature then.
.SH DEFAULT
0, disabled
.SH PROTOCOLS
FTP and SFTP
