.TH CURLOPT_FOLLOWLOCATION 3 "17 Jun 2014" "libcurl 7.37.0" "curl_easy_setopt options"
.SH NAME
CURLOPT_FOLLOWLOCATION \- follow HTTP 3xx redirects
.SH SYNOPSIS
#include <curl/curl.h>

CURLcode curl_easy_setopt(CURL *handle, CURLOPT_FOLLOWLOCATION, long enable);
.SH DESCRIPTION
A parameter set to 1 tells the library to follow any Location: header that the
server sends as part of a HTTP header in a 3xx response.

This means that libcurl will re-send the same request on the new location and
follow new Location: headers all the way until no more such headers are
returned. \fICURLOPT_MAXREDIRS(3)\fP can be used to limit the number of
redirects libcurl will follow.

libcurl can limit to what protocols it will automatically follow. The accepted
protocols are set with \fICURLOPT_REDIR_PROTOCOLS(3)\fP and it excludes the
FILE protocol by default.
.SH DEFAULT
0, disabled
.SH PROTOCOLS

.SH EXAMPLE
