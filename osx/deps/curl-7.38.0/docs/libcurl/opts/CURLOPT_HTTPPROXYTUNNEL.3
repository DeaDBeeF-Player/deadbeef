.TH CURLOPT_HTTPPROXYTUNNEL 3 "17 Jun 2014" "libcurl 7.37.0" "curl_easy_setopt options"
.SH NAME
CURLOPT_HTTPPROXYTUNNEL \- tunnel through HTTP proxy
.SH SYNOPSIS
#include <curl/curl.h>

CURLcode curl_easy_setopt(CURL *handle, CURLOPT_HTTPPROXYTUNNEL, long tunnel);
.SH DESCRIPTION
Set the parameter to 1 to make libcurl tunnel all operations through the HTTP
proxy. There is a big difference between using a proxy and to tunnel through
it. If you don't know what this means, you probably don't want this tunneling
option.

Tunneling essentially means that a CONNECT is sent to the proxy, asking it to
connect to a remote host on a specific port number and then the traffic is
just passed through the proxy. Proxies tend to whitelist specific port numbers
it allows CONNECT requests to and often only port 80 and 443 are allowed.
