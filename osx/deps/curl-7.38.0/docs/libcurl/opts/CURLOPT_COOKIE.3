.TH CURLOPT_COOKIE 3 "17 Jun 2014" "libcurl 7.37.0" "curl_easy_setopt options"
.SH NAME
CURLOPT_COOKIE \- set contents of HTTP Cookie header
.SH SYNOPSIS
#include <curl/curl.h>

CURLcode curl_easy_setopt(CURL *handle, CURLOPT_COOKIE, char *cookie);
.SH DESCRIPTION
Pass a pointer to a zero terminated string as parameter. It will be used to
set a cookie in the HTTP request. The format of the string should be
NAME=CONTENTS, where NAME is the cookie name and CONTENTS is what the cookie
should contain.

If you need to set multiple cookies, set them all using a single option
concatenated like this: "name1=content1; name2=content2;" etc.

This option sets the cookie header explicitly in the outgoing request(s). If
multiple requests are done due to authentication, followed redirections or
similar, they will all get this cookie passed on.

Using this option multiple times will only make the latest string override the
previous ones.

This option will not enable the cookie engine. Use \fICURLOPT_COOKIEFILE(3)\fP
or \fICURLOPT_COOKIEJAR(3)\fP to enable parsing and sending cookies
automatically.
