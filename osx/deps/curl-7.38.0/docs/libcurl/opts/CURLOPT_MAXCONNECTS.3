.TH CURLOPT_MAXCONNECTS 3 "17 Jun 2014" "libcurl 7.37.0" "curl_easy_setopt options"
.SH NAME
CURLOPT_MAXCONNECTS \- set connection cache size
.SH SYNOPSIS
#include <curl/curl.h>

CURLcode curl_easy_setopt(CURL *handle, CURLOPT_MAXCONNECTS, long amount);
.SH DESCRIPTION
Pass a long. The set number will be the persistent connection cache size. The
set \fIamount\fP will be the maximum amount of simultaneously open connections
that libcurl may cache in cache associated with this handle. Default is 5, and
there isn't much point in changing this value unless you are perfectly aware
of how this works and changes libcurl's behaviour. This concerns connections
using any of the protocols that support persistent connections.

When reaching the maximum limit, curl closes the oldest one in the cache to
prevent increasing the number of open connections.

If you already have performed transfers with this curl handle, setting a
smaller \fICURLOPT_MAXCONNECTS(3)\fP than before may cause open connections to
get closed unnecessarily.

If you add this easy handle to a multi handle, this setting is not
acknowledged, and you must instead use \fIcurl_multi_setopt(3)\fP and the
\fICURLMOPT_MAXCONNECTS\fP option.
