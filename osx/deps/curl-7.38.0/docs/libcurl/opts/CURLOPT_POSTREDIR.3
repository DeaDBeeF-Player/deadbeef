.TH CURLOPT_POSTREDIR 3 "19 Jun 2014" "libcurl 7.37.0" "curl_easy_setopt options"
.SH NAME
CURLOPT_POSTREDIR \- how to act on a HTTP POST redirect
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
#include <curl/curl.h>

CURLcode curl_easy_setopt(CURL *handle, CURLOPT_POSTREDIR,
                          long bitmask);
.SH DESCRIPTION
Pass a bitmask to control how libcurl acts on redirects after POSTs that get a
301, 302 or 303 response back.  A parameter with bit 0 set (value
\fBCURL_REDIR_POST_301\fP) tells the library to respect RFC2616/10.3.2 and not
convert POST requests into GET requests when following a 301 redirection.
Setting bit 1 (value \fBCURL_REDIR_POST_302\fP) makes libcurl maintain the
request method after a 302 redirect whilst setting bit 2 (value
\fBCURL_REDIR_POST_303\fP) makes libcurl maintain the request method after a
303 redirect. The value \fBCURL_REDIR_POST_ALL\fP is a convenience define that
sets all three bits.

The non-RFC behaviour is ubiquitous in web browsers, so the library does the
conversion by default to maintain consistency. However, a server may require a
POST to remain a POST after such a redirection. This option is meaningful only
when setting \fICURLOPT_FOLLOWLOCATION(3)\fP.
.SH DEFAULT
0
