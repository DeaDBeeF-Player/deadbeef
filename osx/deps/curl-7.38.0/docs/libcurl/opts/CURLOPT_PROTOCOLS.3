.TH CURLOPT_PROTOCOLS 3 "19 Jun 2014" "libcurl 7.37.0" "curl_easy_setopt options"
.SH NAME
CURLOPT_PROTOCOLS \- set allowed protocols
.SH SYNOPSIS
#include <curl/curl.h>

CURLcode curl_easy_setopt(CURL *handle, CURLOPT_PROTOCOLS, long bitmask);
.SH DESCRIPTION
Pass a long that holds a bitmask of CURLPROTO_* defines. If used, this bitmask
limits what protocols libcurl may use in the transfer. This allows you to have
a libcurl built to support a wide range of protocols but still limit specific
transfers to only be allowed to use a subset of them. By default libcurl will
accept all protocols it supports. See also
\fICURLOPT_REDIR_PROTOCOLS(3)\fP.
.SH DEFAULT
All protocols built-in
.SH PROTOCOLS
All
.SH EXAMPLE
TODO
.SH AVAILABILITY
Added in 7.19.4
.SH RETURN VALUE
Returns CURLE_OK if the option is supported, and CURLE_UNKNOWN_OPTION if not.
.SH "SEE ALSO"
