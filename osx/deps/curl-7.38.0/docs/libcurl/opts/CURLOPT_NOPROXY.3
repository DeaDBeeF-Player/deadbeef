.TH CURLOPT_NOPROXY 3 "19 Jun 2014" "libcurl 7.37.0" "curl_easy_setopt options"
.SH NAME
CURLOPT_NOPROXY \- disable proxy use for specific hosts
.SH SYNOPSIS
#include <curl/curl.h>

CURLcode curl_easy_setopt(CURL *handle, CURLOPT_NOPROXY, char *noproxy);
.SH DESCRIPTION
Pass a pointer to a zero terminated string. The string consists of a comma
separated list of host names that do not require a proxy to get reached, even
if one is specified.  The only wildcard available is a single * character,
which matches all hosts, and effectively disables the proxy. Each name in this
list is matched as either a domain which contains the hostname, or the
hostname itself. For example, example.com would match example.com,
example.com:80, and www.example.com, but not www.notanexample.com or
example.com.othertld.
