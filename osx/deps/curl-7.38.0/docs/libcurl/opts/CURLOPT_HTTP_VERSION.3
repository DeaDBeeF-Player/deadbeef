.SH NAME
CURLOPT_HTTP_VERSION \- specify HTTP protocol version to use
.SH SYNOPSIS
#include <curl/curl.h>

CURLcode curl_easy_setopt(CURL *handle, CURLOPT_HTTP_VERSION, long version);
.SH DESCRIPTION
Pass \fIversion\fP a long, set to one of the values described below. They
force libcurl to use the specific HTTP versions. This is not sensible to do
unless you have a good reason. You have to set this option if you want to use
libcurl's HTTP/2 support.

.IP CURL_HTTP_VERSION_NONE
We don't care about what version the library uses. libcurl will use whatever
it thinks fit.
.IP CURL_HTTP_VERSION_1_0
Enforce HTTP 1.0 requests.
.IP CURL_HTTP_VERSION_1_1
Enforce HTTP 1.1 requests.
.IP CURL_HTTP_VERSION_2_0
Attempt HTTP 2.0 requests. libcurl will fall back to HTTP 1.x if HTTP 2.0
can't be negotiated with the server.

CURL_HTTP_VERSION_NONE
