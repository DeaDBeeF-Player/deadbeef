.TH CURLOPT_PROXY 3 "17 Jun 2014" "libcurl 7.37.0" "curl_easy_setopt options"
.SH NAME
CURLOPT_PROXY \- set proxy to use
.SH SYNOPSIS
#include <curl/curl.h>

CURLcode curl_easy_setopt(CURL *handle, CURLOPT_PROXY, char *proxy);
.SH DESCRIPTION
Set the \fIproxy\fP to use for the upcoming request. The parameter should be a
char * to a zero terminated string holding the host name or dotted IP
address.

To specify port number in this string, append :[port] to the end of the host
name. The proxy's port number may optionally be specified with the separate
option \fICURLOPT_PROXYPORT(3)\fP. If not specified, libcurl will default to
using port 1080 for proxies.

The proxy string may be prefixed with [scheme]:// to specify which kind of
proxy is used. Use socks4://, socks4a://, socks5:// or socks5h:// (the last
one to enable socks5 and asking the proxy to do the resolving, also known as
\fICURLPROXY_SOCKS5_HOSTNAME\fP type) to request the specific SOCKS version to
be used. No protocol specified, http:// and all others will be treated as HTTP
proxies.

Without a scheme prefix, \fICURLOPT_PROXYTYPE(3)\fP can be used to specify
which kind of proxy the string identifies.

When you tell the library to use a HTTP proxy, libcurl will transparently
convert operations to HTTP even if you specify an FTP URL etc. This may have
an impact on what other features of the library you can use, such as
\fICURLOPT_QUOTE(3)\fP and similar FTP specifics that don't work unless you
tunnel through the HTTP proxy. Such tunneling is activated with
\fICURLOPT_HTTPPROXYTUNNEL(3)\fP.

libcurl respects the environment variables \fBhttp_proxy\fP, \fBftp_proxy\fP,
\fBall_proxy\fP etc, if any of those are set. The \fICURLOPT_PROXY(3)\fP
option does however override any possibly set environment variables.

Setting the proxy string to "" (an empty string) will explicitly disable the
use of a proxy, even if there is an environment variable set for it.

A proxy host string given in an environment variable can also include protocol
scheme (http://) and embedded user + password.
.SH DEFAULT
Default is NULL, meaning no proxy is used.

When you set a host name to use, do not assume that there's any particular
single port number used widely for proxies. Specify it!
.SH PROTOCOLS
All except file://. Note that some protocols don't do very well over proxy.
.SH EXAMPLE
TODO
.SH AVAILABILITY
Since 7.14.1 the proxy environment variable names can include the protocol
scheme.

Since 7.21.7 the proxy string supports the socks protocols as "schemes".
.SH RETURN VALUE
Returns CURLE_OK if proxies are supported, CURLE_UNKNOWN_OPTION if not, or
CURLE_OUT_OF_MEMORY if there was insufficient heap space.
