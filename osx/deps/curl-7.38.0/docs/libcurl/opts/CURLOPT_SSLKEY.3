.SH NAME
CURLOPT_SSLKEY \- specify private keyfile for TLS and SSL client cert
.SH SYNOPSIS
#include <curl/curl.h>

CURLcode curl_easy_setopt(CURL *handle, CURLOPT_SSLKEY, char *keyfile);
.SH DESCRIPTION
Pass a pointer to a zero terminated string as parameter. The string should be
the file name of your private key. The default format is "PEM" and can be
changed with \fICURLOPT_SSLKEYTYPE(3)\fP.

Secure Transport. Secure Transport expects the private key to be already
present in the keychain or PKCS#12 file containing the certificate.
.SH DEFAULT

All TLS based protocols: HTTPS, FTPS, IMAPS, POP3, SMTPS etc.
.SH EXAMPLE

If built TLS enabled.
.SH RETURN VALUE
Returns CURLE_OK if TLS is supported, CURLE_UNKNOWN_OPTION if not, or
CURLE_OUT_OF_MEMORY if there was insufficient heap space.
