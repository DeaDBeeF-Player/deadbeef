.TH CURLOPT_IGNORE_CONTENT_LENGTH 3 "19 Jun 2014" "libcurl 7.37.0" "curl_easy_setopt options"
.SH NAME
CURLOPT_IGNORE_CONTENT_LENGTH \- ignore Content-Length in HTTP response
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
#include <curl/curl.h>

CURLcode curl_easy_setopt(CURL *handle, CURLOPT_IGNORE_CONTENT_LENGTH,
                          long ignore);
.SH DESCRIPTION
If \fIignore\fP is set to 1, ignore the Content-Length header in the HTTP
response. This is useful for Apache 1.x (and similar servers) which will
report incorrect content length for files over 2 gigabytes. If this option is
used, curl will not be able to accurately report progress, and will simply
stop the download when the server ends the connection.

Only use this option if strictly necessary.
