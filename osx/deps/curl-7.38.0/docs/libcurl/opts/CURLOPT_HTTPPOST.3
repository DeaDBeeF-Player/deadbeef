.TH CURLOPT_HTTPPOST 3 "17 Jun 2014" "libcurl 7.37.0" "curl_easy_setopt options"
.SH NAME
CURLOPT_HTTPPOST \- specify the multipart formpost content
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
#include <curl/curl.h>

CURLcode curl_easy_setopt(CURL *handle, CURLOPT_HTTPPOST,
                          struct curl_httppost *formpost);
.SH DESCRIPTION
Tells libcurl you want a multipart/formdata HTTP POST to be made and you
instruct what data to pass on to the server in the \fIformpost\fP argument.
Pass a pointer to a linked list of curl_httppost structs as parameter.  The
easiest way to create such a list, is to use \fIcurl_formadd(3)\fP as
documented. The data in this list must remain intact until you close this curl
handle again with \fIcurl_easy_cleanup(3)\fP.

Using POST with HTTP 1.1 implies the use of a "Expect: 100-continue" header.
You can disable this header with \fICURLOPT_HTTPHEADER(3)\fP.

When setting \fICURLOPT_HTTPPOST(3)\fP, it will automatically set
\fICURLOPT_NOBODY(3)\fP to 0.
