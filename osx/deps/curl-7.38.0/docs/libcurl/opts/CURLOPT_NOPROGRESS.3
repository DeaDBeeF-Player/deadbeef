.TH CURLOPT_NOPROGRESS 3 "16 Jun 2014" "libcurl 7.37.0" "curl_easy_setopt options"
.SH NAME
CURLOPT_NOPROGRESS \- switch off the progress meter
.SH SYNOPSIS
#include <curl/curl.h>

CURLcode curl_easy_setopt(CURL *handle, CURLOPT_NOPROGRESS, long onoff);
.SH DESCRIPTION
If \fIonoff\fP is to 1, it tells the library to shut off the progress meter
completely for requests done with this \fIhandle\fP. It will also prevent the
\fICURLOPT_PROGRESSFUNCTION(3)\fP from getting called.

Future versions of libcurl are likely to not have any built-in progress meter
at all.
.SH DEFAULT
1, meaning it normally runs without a progress meter.
.SH RETURN VALUE
Returns CURLE_OK.
.SH "SEE ALSO"
.BR CURLOPT_PROGRESSFUNCTION "(3), "
