.SH NAME
out123 \- play raw PCM audio to an output device
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B cat audio.raw | out123
[
.B options
]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B out123
reads raw PCM data (in host byte order) from standard input 
and plays it on the audio device specified by given options.
.SH OPTIONS
.B out123
options may be either the traditional POSIX one letter options,
or the GNU style long options.  POSIX style options start with a
single ``\-'', while GNU long options start with ``\-\^\-''.
Option arguments (if needed) follow separated by whitespace (not ``='').
Note that some options can be absent from your installation when disabled in the build process.
.TP
\fB\-o \fImodule\fR, \-\^\-output \fImodule\fR
Select audio output module. You can provide a comma-separated list to use the first one that works.
.TP
\fB\-\^\-list\-modules
List the available modules.
.TP
\fB\-a \fIdev\fR, \fB\-\^\-audiodevice \fIdev
Specify the audio device to use.  The default is
system-dependent (usually /dev/audio or /dev/dsp).
Use this option if you have multiple audio devices and
the default is not what you want.
.TP
.BR \-s ", " \-\^\-stdout
The audio samples are written to standard output,
instead of playing them through the audio device.
The output format is the same as the input ... so in this mode, 
.B mpg123
acts like the standard tool \fB cat.
.TP
\fB\-O \fIfile\fR, \fB\-\^\-outfile
Write raw output into a file (instead of simply redirecting standard output to a file with the shell).
.TP
\fB\-w \fIfile\fR, \fB\-\^\-wav
Write output as WAV file
.I file
, or standard output if
.I -
is used as file name. You can also use
.I --au
and
.I --cdr
for AU and CDR format, respectively. Note that WAV/AU writing to non-seekable files or redirected stdout needs some thought. The header is written with the first actual data. The result of decoding nothing to WAV/AU is a file consisting just of the header when it is seekable and really nothing when not (not even a header). Correctly writing data with prophetic headers to stdout is no easy business.
.TP
\fB\-\^\-au \fIfile
Write to
.I file
in SUN audio format.  If \- is used as the filename, the AU file is
written to stdout. See paragraph about WAV writing for header fun with non-seekable streams.
.TP
\fB\-\^\-cdr \fIfile
Write to
.I file
as a CDR (CD-ROM audio, more correctly CDDA for Compact Disc Digital Audio).
If \- is used as the filename, the CDR file is written
to stdout.
.TP
.BR \-m ", " \-\^\-mono "
Set for single-channel audio (default is two channels, stereo).
.TP
.BR \-\-stereo
Select stereo output (2 channels, default).
.TP
\fB\-r \fIrate\fR, \fB\-\^\-rate \fIrate
Set sample rate in Hz (default: 44100). If this does not match the actual input
sampling rate, you get changed pitch. Might be intentional;-)
.TP
\fp\-e \fIenc\fR, \fB\-\^\-encoding \fIenc
Choose output sample encoding. Possible values look like f32 (32-bit floating point), s32 (32-bit signed integer), u32 (32-bit unsigned integer) and the variants with different numbers of bits (s24, u24, s16, u16, s8, u8) and also special variants like ulaw and alaw 8-bit.
See the output of out123's longhelp for actually available encodings.
Default is s16.
.TP
.BR "\-o h" ", " \-\^\-headphones
Direct audio output to the headphone connector (some hardware only; AIX, HP, SUN).
.TP
.BR "\-o s" ", " \-\^\-speaker
Direct audio output to the speaker  (some hardware only; AIX, HP, SUN).
.TP
.BR "\-o l" ", " \-\^\-lineout
Direct audio output to the line-out connector (some hardware only; AIX, HP, SUN).
.TP
\fB\-b \fIsize\fR, \fB\-\^\-buffer \fIsize
Use an audio output buffer of
.I size
Kbytes.  This is useful to bypass short periods of heavy
system activity, which would normally cause the audio output 
to be interrupted.  
You should specify a buffer size of at least 1024 
(i.e. 1 Mb, which equals about 6 seconds of usual audio data) or more; 
less than about 300 does not make much sense.  The default is 0, 
which turns buffering off.
.TP
\fB\-\^\-preload \fIfraction
Wait for the buffer to be filled to
.I fraction
before starting playback (fraction between 0 and 1). You can tune this prebuffering to either get sound faster to your ears or safer uninterrupted web radio.
Default is 1 (wait for full buffer before playback).
.TP
.BR \-t ", " \-\^\-test
Test mode.  The audio stream is read, but no output occurs.
.TP
.BR \-v ", " \-\^\-verbose
Increase the verbosity level.
.TP
.BR \-q ", " \-\^\-quiet
Quiet.  Suppress diagnostic messages.
.TP
\fB\-\^\-aggressive
Tries to get higher priority
.TP
.BR \-T ", " \-\-realtime
Tries to gain realtime priority.  This option usually requires root
privileges to have any effect.
.TP
.BR \-? ", " \-\^\-help
Shows short usage instructions.
.TP
.BR \-\^\-longhelp
Shows long usage instructions.
.TP
.BR \-\^\-version
Print the version string.
