.SH DESCRIPTION
.B ogginfo
reads one or more Ogg files and prints information about stream contents 
(including chained and/or multiplexed streams) to standard output. It will 
detect (but not correct) a wide range of common defects, with many 
additional checks specifically for Ogg Vorbis streams.

For all stream types
.B ogginfo
will print the filename being processed, the stream serial numbers, and various
common error conditions.

For
.B Vorbis
streams, information including the version used for encoding, the sample rate
and number of channels, the bitrate and playback length, and the contents of
the comment header are printed.

Similarly, for
.B Theora
streams, basic information about the video is provided, including frame rate, aspect ratio, bitrate, length, and the comment header.

.SH OPTIONS
.IP -h
Show a help and usage message.
.IP -q
Quiet mode. This may be specified multiple times. Doing so once will remove
the detailed informative messages, twice will remove warnings as well.
.IP -v
Verbose mode. At the current time, this does not do anything.
