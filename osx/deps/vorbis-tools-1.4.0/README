WHAT'S HERE:

This source distribution includes the vorbis-tools and nothing else.
The audio codec libraries for use with Ogg bitstreams are contained in
other modules: vorbis, speex and flac.


DIRECTORIES:

debian/		debian packaging stuff
include/	header files shared between the tools
intl/		GNU gettext library from gettext-0.10.40 (for i18n support)
ogg123/		an ogg vorbis command line audio player
oggenc/		the ogg vorbis encoder
oggdec/		a simple, portable command line decoder (to wav and raw)
ogginfo/	provides information (tags, bitrate, length, etc.) about
		an ogg vorbis file
po/		translations for non-English languages
share/		code shared between the tools
vcut/		cuts an ogg vorbis file into two parts at a particular point
vorbiscomment/	edits the comments in an ogg vorbis file
win32/		Win32 build stuff


DEPENDENCIES:

All of the tools require libogg and libvorbis to be installed (along
with the header files).  Additionally, ogg123 requires libao, libcurl,
and a POSIX-compatible thread library.  Ogg123 can optionally compiled
to use libFLAC, and libspeex.  Oggenc can be optionally compiled with
libFLAC, and libkate.  The libraries libogg, libvorbis, and libao are
all available at
  http://www.vorbis.com/download.psp

The libcurl library is packaged with most Linux distributions.  The
source code can also be downloaded from:
  http://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/

FLAC is available at:
  http://flac.sourceforge.net

Speex is available at:
  http://www.speex.org/

libkate is available at:
  http://libkate.googlecode.com/


CONTACT:

The Ogg Vorbis homepage is located at 'http://www.vorbis.com'. Up to
date technical documents, contact information, source code and
pre-built utilities may be found there.

Developer information is available from http://www.xiph.org/. Check
there for bug reporting information, mailing lists and other resources.


BUILDING FROM SUBVERSION (see the file HACKING for details):

./autogen.sh
make 

and as root if desired :

make install

This will install the tools into /usr/local/bin and manpages into
/usr/local/man.


BUILDING FROM TARBALL DISTRIBUTIONS:

./configure
make

and as root if desired :

make install

BUILDING RPMS:

RPMs may be built by:

after autogen.sh or configure

make dist
rpm -ta vorbis-tools-<version>.tar.gz


KNOWN BUGS:

#1321
  First noticed in non-English versions of the application, ogg123 has a major
  bug when it comes to status messages in the shell: any output bigger than
  the console's width will break and start spamming that message infinitely
  until the console is resized.

  Different attempts to fix this bug have ended up causing bigger problems,
  leading to the conclusion that it simply can't be fixed without a large
  re-write of the application, which will not happen any time soon.  If you
  come across this issue, please augment your terminal window size.
