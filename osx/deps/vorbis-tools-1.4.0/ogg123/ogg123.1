.SH DESCRIPTION
.B ogg123
reads Ogg Vorbis audio files and decodes them to the devices specified
on the command line.  By default,
.B ogg123
writes to the standard sound device, but output can be sent to any
number of devices.  Files can be read from the file system, or URLs
can be streamed via HTTP.  If a directory is given, all of the files in
it or its subdirectories will be played.

.SH OPTIONS
.IP "--audio-buffer n"
Use an output audio buffer of approximately 'n' kilobytes.
.IP "-@ playlist, --list playlist"
Play all of the files named in the file 'playlist'.  The playlist should have
one filename, directory name, or URL per line.  Blank lines are permitted.
Directories will be treated in the same way as on the command line.
.IP "-b n, --buffer n"
Use an input buffer of approximately 'n' kilobytes.  HTTP-only option.
.IP "-p n, --prebuffer n"
Prebuffer 'n' percent of the input buffer.  Playback won't begin until
this prebuffer is complete.  HTTP-only option.
.IP "-d device, --device device"
Specify output device.  See
.B DEVICES
section for a list of devices.  Any number of devices may be specified.
.IP "-f filename, --file filename"
Specify output file for file devices.  The filename "-" writes to standard
out.  If the file already exists,
.B ogg123
will overwrite it.
.IP "-h, --help"
Show command help.
.IP "-k n, --skip n"
Skip the first 'n' seconds.  'n' may also be in minutes:seconds or 
hours:minutes:seconds form.
.IP "-K n, --end n"
Stops playing 'n' seconds from the start of the stream.  'n' may also have the
same format as used in the
.I --skip
option.
.IP "-o option[:value], --device-option option[:value]"
Sets the option
.I option
to 
.I value
for the preceding device.  See
.B DEVICES
for a list of valid options for each device.
.IP "-q, --quiet"
Quiet mode.  No messages are displayed.
.IP "-V, --version"
Display version information.
.IP "-v, --verbose"
Increase verbosity.
.IP "-x n, --nth"
Play every 'n'th decoded block.  Has the effect of playing audio at 'n' times
faster than normal speed.
.IP "-y n, --ntimes"
Repeat every played block 'n' times.  Has the effect of playing audio 'n'
times slower than normal speed.  May be with -x for interesting fractional
speeds.
.IP "-r, --repeat"
Repeat playlist indefinitely.
.IP "-z, --shuffle"
Play files in pseudo-random order.
.IP "-Z, --random"
Play files in pseudo-random order forever.

.SH DEVICES

.B ogg123
supports a variety of audio output devices through libao.  Only those
devices supported by the target platform will be available.  The
.B -f
option may only be used with devices that write to files.

Options supported by all devices:
.RS
.IP debug
Turn on debugging output [if any] for a chosen driver.
.IP matrix:value
Force a specific output channel ordering for a given device.  
.I value
is a comma 
seperated list of AO style channel names, eg, L,R,C,LFE,BL,BR,SL,SR.
.IP verbose
Turn on verbose output for a chosen driver. the -v option will also set the 
driver verbose option.
.IP quiet
Force chosen driver to be completely silent.  Even errors will not produce any 
output. -q will also set the driver quiet option.
.RE

.B
.IP aixs
AIX live output driver. Options:
.RS
.IP dev:value
Set AIX output device to
.I value
.RE

.B
.IP alsa
Advanced Linux Sound Architecture live output driver. Options:
.RS
.IP buffer_time:value
Override the default hardware buffer size (in milliseconds).
.IP dev:value
ALSA device label to use. Examples include "hw:0" for the first soundcard 
and "hw:1" for the second.  The alsa driver normally chooses one of 
"surround71", 
"surround51", 
"surround40" or 
"default" 
automatically depending on number of output channels.  For more information,
see http://alsa.opensrc.org/ALSA+device+labels
.IP period_time:value
Override the default hardware period size (in microseconds).
.IP period_time:value
Override the default hardware period size (in microseconds).
.IP use_mmap:value
.I value
is set to "yes" or "no" to override the compiled-in default to use or not use 
mmap device access.  In the past, some buggy alsa drivers have behaved better when
not using mmap access at the penalty of slightly higher CPU usage.
.RE

.B
.IP arts
aRts Sound Daemon live output driver. Options:
.RS
.IP multi:value
.I value
is set to "yes" or "no" to allow opening the aRts playback device for multiply
concurrent playback.  Although the driver works properly in multi mode, it is 
known to occasionally crash the aRts server itself.  Default behavior is "no".
.RE

.B
.IP au
Sun audio file output.  Writes the audio samples in AU format.  The AU
format supports writing to unseekable files like standard out.  In
such circumstances, the AU header will specify the sample format, but
not the length of the recording.

.B
.IP esd
Enlightened Sound Daemon live output. Options:
.RS
.IP host:value
.I value
specifies the hostname where esd is running.  This can include a port number
after a colon, as in "whizbang.com:555".  (Default = localhost)
.RE

.B
.IP irix
IRIX live output audio driver.

.B
.IP macosx
MacOS X 'AUHAL' live output driver.  This driver supports MacOS X
10.5 and later (10.4 and earlier uses an earlier, incompatable

.SH EXAMPLES

The
.B ogg123
command line is fairly flexible, perhaps confusingly so.  Here are
some sample command lines and an explanation of what they do.
.PP

Play on the default soundcard:
.RS
.B ogg123 test.ogg
.RE
.PP

Play all of the files in the directory ~/music and its subdirectories.
.RS
.B ogg123 ~/music
.RE
.PP

Play a file using the OSS driver:
.RS
.B ogg123 -d oss test.ogg
.RE
.PP

Pass the "dsp" option to the OSS driver: 
.RS
.B ogg123 -d oss -o dsp:/dev/mydsp 
.RE
.PP

Use the ESD driver
.RS
.B ogg123 -d esd test.ogg
.RE
.PP

Use the WAV driver with the output file, "test.wav":
.RS
.B ogg123 -d wav -f test.wav test.ogg
.RE
.PP

Listen to a file while you write it to a WAV file:
.RS
.B ogg123 -d oss -d wav -f test.wav test.ogg
.RE
.PP

Note that options apply to the device declared to the left:
.RS
.B ogg123 -d oss -o dsp:/dev/mydsp -d raw -f test2.raw -o byteorder:big test.ogg
.RE
.PP

Stress test your harddrive:
.RS
.B ogg123 -d oss -d wav -f 1.wav -d wav -f 2.wav -d wav -f 3.wav -d wav -f 4.wav -d wav -f 5.wav  test.ogg
.RE
.PP

Create an echo effect with esd and a slow computer:
.RS
.B ogg123 -d esd -d esd test.ogg
.RE
.PP

.SH INTERRUPT
You can abort
.B ogg123
at any time by pressing Ctrl-C.  If you are playing multiple
files, this will stop the current file and begin playing the
next one.  If you want to abort playing immediately instead
of skipping to the next file, press Ctrl-C within the first
second of the playback of a new file.
.P
Note that the result of pressing Ctrl-C might not be audible
immediately, due to audio data buffering in the audio device.
This delay is system dependent, but it is usually not more
than one or two seconds.

.SH FILES

.TP
/etc/libao.conf
Can be used to set the default output device for all libao programs.

.TP
~/.libao
Per-user config file to override the system wide output device settings.
.PP

.SH BUGS

Piped WAV files may cause strange behavior in other programs.  This is
because WAV files store the data length in the header.  However, the
output driver does not know the length when it writes the header, and
there is no value that means "length unknown".  Use the raw or au
output driver if you need to use ogg123 in a pipe.
