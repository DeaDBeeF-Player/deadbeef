WildMidi v0.2.0 Release

Introduction
==============

WildMidi is a wave table player that uses gus pat sound sets to play midi file. The WildMidi player
is the frontend, and is only designed to pass information to the core library and output any audio
data the library returns.

The core of the project, libWildMidi, is the work horse behind the player. Designed to be used in future
and existing projects, like QuakeForge (http://www.quakeforge.net), its capable of multithreading and
multiprocessing of midi files, allowing for the mixing of multiple midi file at any one time if someone
had a desire to do so. This library is what turns the midi files into audio data using the gus pat sets.

Not all midi events are supported by the core library at this stage, and more research is being done to
improve performance and quality so that more events can be added.

At the moment Wildmidi will only work in linux and cygwin. Native windows support is not available 
at this stage but is planned.


Installation
==============
to compile and install wildmidi use the following proceedure

./configure
make
make install

This will work for both linux and cygwin

FreeBSD users, use ./configure --with-timidity-cfg=/usr/local/share/timidity/timidity.cfg

If you want to change the default timidity.cfg path and/or file use --with-timidity-cfg=/full/path_and_filename/of/new/config.cfg

Running
=============

NOTE: it is assumed here that your system is setup correctly and that you have
installed some gus pats. I personally recommend eawpats, but you may have your
own favorates.

If you have /etc/timidity.cfg, once installed you can simply do 

wildmidi <midi file name>

if not, you can use the command line option -c to point wildmidi to the timidity.cfg

example: wildmidi -c ~/guspats/timidity.cfg 


Once the program is running, you can quit from it by pressing q

Cygwin users: Yes, I know about the screen roll. I am looking at a different interface
		  to corrct this.
