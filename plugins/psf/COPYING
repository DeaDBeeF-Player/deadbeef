Here is a list of the licenses each file in this package are under, and their text.

The upshot is this: if you create anything from this SDK and include any MAME licensed components
(which are an integral part of each engine supplied) you must distribute the source code to your
derivative program.

GPL license:

Too long to include here.

See eng_psf/peops/License.txt or eng_psf/peops2/License.txt for the complete text.

While legally combining GPL with BSD and MAME licensed software is unclear, Pete Bernert 
will probably be OK with anything you do as long as you distribute the source for your
AOSDK based creations.
