Update list since 0.4.0u3 (03.12.2012)
- replaced some larger swich statements with function pointers (small speed up)
- fixed Stereo flag in SN76496 OPL mapper
- optimized playback routine (huge speed up, >20% for single-chip VGMs)
- writing to a second chip if only the first one is defined doesn't cause crashes anymore

- slight improvements on OPL Hardware Playback
- fixed bug where [VGMPlay Linux] was unable to show Unicode characters
- added multiple paths for VGMPlay.ini and OPL4 ROM
- [VGMPlay Linux] is now checking for "vgmplay.ini" as well as "VGMPlay.ini"
- cleaned the code a bit
- [VGMPlay] now frees its memory properly when quitting

17.04.2013 and later:
- improved skipping code for OPL hardware (to hopefully reduce noise after seeking)
- made Makefile print short information instead of full gcc command lines
- added possibility to override volume (+gain) of VGMs when using OPL hardware
- [VGMPlay] made it use stderr for error messages
- added optional debug output for DAC stream control (current data block, frequency)
- fixed a bug with data blocks being re-read when restarting playback (wasted memory)
- [VGMPlay] fixed bug when alternating between OPL hardware playback and emulation without restarting VGMPlay (e.g. via playlist with OPL and non-OPL VGMs)
- fixed crash where the NES ROM could be written to invalid offsets
- added alternative AY8910 core (EMU2149)
- added NES DPCM address overflow behaviour, added alternative DPCM range (based on NSFPlay)

15.06.2013 and later:
- [VGMPlay] console title now changes to "Song (Game) - VGM Player" while playing
- [VGMPlay] made it fall back to Japanese tags if English ones are empty
- [VGMPlay] made Console title use Unicode (yes, that works - not like the in-Console text)
- [in_vgm] made ANSI GetFileInfo function fall back to Japanese tags if English ones are not present
- [in_vgm] fixed Unicode -> ANSI filename conversion bug (caused Unicode Tag function to fail with some non-ANSI filenames)
- [in_vgm] fixed File Info Dialog falling back to tags of the other language (it isn't supposed to do that)
- [VGMPlay] some Codepage fixes for Windows version, hopefully it now behaves correctly in all cases.
  The Linux version should now be able to print non-ANSI Unicode characters in tags.
- [VGMPlay Windows] now writes Unicode to the console (via WinAPI), so with the non-raster-fonts Japanese characters should work now. (although I only saw square boxes in WinXP, copying and pasting into Notepad worked at least)
- [in_vgm] Fixed bug where "Chip Rate" == 0 didn't work and would get reset to 44100 when loading the plugin.
- fixed bug where YM2612 Database Block caused DAC Stream Control to malfunction or crash (The MAME devs were right - realloc IS evil.)

09.09.2013 and later:
- added WonderSwan support
- added better SN-PSG name display

- cleaned code that loads VGMs a bit
- shortened the Chip Stop routine
- applied MAME fixes to YM2413/YMF262 (thread safe now), K051649 (added test register, changed sound generation code a bit), K054539 (replaced sound generation code, might improve reverb), YMZ280B (minor stuff), YMF271 (FM code replaced, sounds different now!)

- [in_vgm] fixed track length display bug after changing the playback rate
- [VGMPlay Linux] fixed warnings that are printed from ym2612.c
- added VRC7 mode for YM2413 (reducing features and using separate instrument set)
- [in_vgm] made OK button of File Dialog return another error code to Winamp to prevent a playlist bug

Updates since 0.4.0u4 (02.11.2013)
- added code for muting channels to K053260 (looks like I forgot that one) and K054539 (lost when applying MAME fixes)
- made K054539 use a proper clock (with a fallback for older VGMs)
- added a small hack that allows mid-song sample rate changes for the OKIM6258 chip (I'll make a proper implementation for 0.41)
- [VGMPlay] fixed absolute paths in m3u files
- [VGMPlay] fixed path handling, makes paths that contain / and \ work in both Windows and Unix, fixes m3u Windows paths under Unix
- fixed pitch of YM2608 ADPCM Tom Tom and Rim Shot (reported by MaliceX)
- fixed YM2612 Timer A (there are still tiny rounding errors though), this fixed the CSM mode
- fixed probable YM2612 bug (CSM mode was able to prevent KeyOn/Off commands on channels other than FM3)
- fixed noise calculation in MAME's AY8910 (applied latest MAME update)
- fixed a few crashes related to corrupted VGM headers with invalid offsets and insane clock values (though not all)
- [VGMPlay] MuteWTCh# now works in VGMPlay.ini
- fixed clicks in YMF278B core (introduced when porting it from openMSX)
- [VGMPlay] fixed length display when VGMs play slower/faster after using the PlaybackRate option
- fixed bug where VGZs with additional 00s at the end won't play (because VGMPlay will read an unpacked size of 0 bytes)
- changed Endianess of SCSP RAM data to Big Endian (as it should be)
- applied MAME QSound fixes (key on register, chip initialization)
- removed last A from AY-3-8910A and variants
- added an option to force OKIM6258 into 12-bit mode (makes it louder sometimes, but an internal 12-bit calculation seems to be more correct)
- VGMs using the OKIM6258 or OKIM6295 are now half as loud (affects global volume only, not chip-relative volume)
- [VGMPlay] fixed crash that happened on Linux when trying to display a large Notes tag (thanks to vampi-the-frog for the report)
- OKIM6258 lowers its output signal faster if there's no incoming data (reduces clicks)

Updates since 0.4.0u5 (13.04.2014)
- fixed panning in AdLibEmu with 4-op instruments (it used the bits from Channel+0 instead of Channel+3)
- fixed panning in AdLibEmu for rhythm channels
- [VGMPlay] fixed YM2608/YM2610 DeltaT-channel not being muteable via MuteMask_PCM
- [VGMPlay] fixed muting of YM278B's FM drums
- applied MAME YM2612 Timer fix (said to fix SFX in Streets of Rage 2, see MAME Testers 05049)
- fixed C140 sub chip type and C140/System 21 banking (using current MAME code)
- added code to handle "real" C140 clock
- [VGMPlay] fixed "make install" (the share/vgmplay/ folder was created without "execute" rights for users)
- improved OKIM6258 data cache (should reduce clicks a bit)
- YMF278B: fixed OPL3 register writes and OPL3 chip clock
- applied MAME K053260 DPCM decoding fix
- applied MAME OPLx Key Scale Level fix
- added 40h-byte-FIFO to UPD7759 chip when in Slave mode, based on how Sega Pico games work

  Thanks to the developers of foo_input_vgm for noticing this bug.
- added NMK112 banking to OKIM6295 emulation
- added callback function for chip sample rate change
  -> replaces OKIM6258 hack
  -> fixes OPN SSG with MAME AY emulation
  -> makes OKIM6295 clock changes work
- added routines for wide-character file names (only used by in_vgm for now)
- fixed RAM write range check for RF5C68 and RF5C164
- made OKIM6258 FIFO queue larger, added RemoveDCOfs option
- [VGMPlay] fixed tag display under Windows 95

- [VGMPlay] fixed Loop Length (is now adjusted for changed playback rates)

Updates since 0.4.0u6 (30.05.2015)
- fixed SAA1099 muting (muting channel 1 or 4 prevented the envelope generator from running, thus muting 0-2 or 3-5 respectively)
- made SAA1099 output bipolar
- [VGMPlay] fix compiling under Linux (broken since Wide-Charcter file name support)
- fixed ES5503 sample rate (divider was off by one)
- applied fix from VOGONS that makes the SAA1099 core actually use the chip clock
