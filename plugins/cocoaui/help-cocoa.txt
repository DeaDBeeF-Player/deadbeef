* CUESHEETS

    To use cuesheets, just open/add the cue files, select audio + cue files in the file dialog, or add whole folders with audio and cue files to playlist.

    Adding a single audio file would not load a cuesheet, unless it's embedded in the file.

* CONFIGURATION

    Most settings can be configured through the Preferences dialog.

    All configuration is stored in the $HOME/Library/Preferences/deadbeef folder.
    Individual settings can be tweaked in the $HOME/Library/Preferences/config text file.

    You should exit the player before editing this file, or your changes will be overwritten.

* ALBUM ART DISPLAY

    To display album art in the playlist, you need to perform the following steps:

    1. Add new column, and choose the "Album Art" column type
    2. Right click on the playlist column headers, and in the context menu select "Group by" submenu. Click "Artist/Date/Album", or another option which you prefer.
