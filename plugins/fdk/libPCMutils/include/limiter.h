Software License for The Fraunhofer FDK AAC Codec Library for Android

© Copyright  1995 - 2018 Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft zur Förderung der angewandten
Forschung e.V. All rights reserved.

 1.    INTRODUCTION
The Fraunhofer FDK AAC Codec Library for Android ("FDK AAC Codec") is software
that implements the MPEG Advanced Audio Coding ("AAC") encoding and decoding
scheme for digital audio. This FDK AAC Codec software is intended to be used on
a wide variety of Android devices.

AAC's HE-AAC and HE-AAC v2 versions are regarded as today's most efficient
general perceptual audio codecs. AAC-ELD is considered the best-performing
full-bandwidth communications codec by independent studies and is widely
deployed. AAC has been standardized by ISO and IEC as part of the MPEG
specifications.

Patent licenses for necessary patent claims for the FDK AAC Codec (including
those of Fraunhofer) may be obtained through Via Licensing
(www.vialicensing.com) or through the respective patent owners individually for
the purpose of encoding or decoding bit streams in products that are compliant
with the ISO/IEC MPEG audio standards. Please note that most manufacturers of
Android devices already license these patent claims through Via Licensing or
directly from the patent owners, and therefore FDK AAC Codec software may
already be covered under those patent licenses when it is used for those
licensed purposes only.

Commercially-licensed AAC software libraries, including floating-point versions
with enhanced sound quality, are also available from Fraunhofer. Users are
encouraged to check the Fraunhofer website for additional applications
information and documentation.

You may not charge copyright license fees for anyone to use, copy or distribute
