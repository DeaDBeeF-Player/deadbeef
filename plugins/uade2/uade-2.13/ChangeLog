2007-04-29  Heikki Orsila <heikki.orsila@iki.fi>
	- Added Special FX ST replayer from Don Adan
	- Added a new version of Special FX replayer from Don Adan

2007-04-27  Heikki Orsila <heikki.orsila@iki.fi>
	- Work-arounded libao/alsa so that it drains the audio device for
	  the last few milliseconds of song data for the last played song.
	  Thanks to Cthulhu for pointing out the problem.

2007-04-15  Michael Doering <mld@users.sourceforge.net>
	- Bug in songlength database handling fixed (shd)
	
2007-04-14  Michael Doering <mld@users.sourceforge.net>

	  plugin. (shd, mld)
	- Fixed misdetection and modlen calculation bug of Soundtracker IV
	  mods. (shd/mld)

2007-04-09  Heikki Orsila <heikki.orsila@iki.fi>
	* UADE 2.06 (7 YEARS BIRTHDAY PARTY AT PAULAS!)
	- UADE project is now exactly 7 years old \o/ PARTY!
	- Started working for Audacious 1.3 support, at least songs that
	  are added directly through playlist should work if they are
	  regular files. Audacious VFS is not supported in general. Nothing
	  else is guaranteed. Audacious < 1.3 works as in the past.
	- Infogrames replayer improved, gobliins 2 et al. play with correct
	  tempo
	- Added new Quartet ST player from Don Adan / Wanted Team
	  (qts.* files)
	- KRIS aka Chip Tracker replayer (KRIS.* files) from Don Adan /
	  Wanted team. This replaces PTK-Prowiz for Chip Tracker songs, so
	  not a new format.
	- Quartet PSG replayer (SQT.* files) from Don Adan / Wanted Team
	- Many small changes, cleanups etc

	- Fixed user installation of Audacious 1.3 plugin...

2007-03-19  Michael Doering <mld@users.sourceforge.net>
	- Merged Christian Birchingers Audacious 1.3.x API Patches in.

2007-03-03  Heikki Orsila <heikki.orsila@iki.fi>
	- KRIS aka Chip Tracker replayer (KRIS.* files) from Don Adan /
	  Wanted team. This replaces PTK-Prowiz for Chip Tracker songs, so
	  not a new format.
	- Quartet PSG replayer (SQT.* files) from Don Adan / Wanted Team

2007-02-13  Heikki Orsila <heikki.orsila@iki.fi>
	- Updated Inforgrames player to use tempo 0x24ff for Ween songs.
	  Thanks to DrMcCoy of SCUMM VM project.
	- Reverted Michael's 2007-02-13 patch regarding LC_Numeric and
	  strtod(). Fixed the problem manually by converting x,y values into
	  x.y format and vice versa.

2007-02-13  Michael Doering <mld@users.sourceforge.net>
	- Fix for German LC_Numeric="," parameters in uadeconfig.c.
	  Thanks for Steffen Wulf for reporting.
	- Bumped Version to 2.05. :-)

2007-02-08  Michael Doering <mld@users.sourceforge.net>
	- Added new Quartet ST player from Don Adan / Wanted Team
          (qts.* files). Great work as ever Don!
	- Disabled Hippel COSO check in amifilemagic.c to avoid a conflict
          between Amiga and Atari ST Coso Files.
	  TODO: The file heuristics for Coso in amifilemagic.c has to be fixed,
          the checkroutine of the Amiga Hippel-Coso replayer isn't HIP-ST Coso
          aware either.

2007-02-06  Michael Doering <mld@users.sourceforge.net>
	- Small correction of shd's patch in PTK-Prowiz commited.

2007-02-05  Michael Doering <mld@users.sourceforge.net>
	- Applied shd's uade_new_get_info patch to PTK-Prowiz.

2007-02-04  Michael Doering <mld@users.sourceforge.net>
	- Added sanity check to query eagleopts in PTK-Prowiz (needed for
	  score fix)
	- Added a new uade.library method: UadeNewGetInfo(). It is now used
	  with Infogrames replayer (see
	  amigasrc/players/infogrames/Infogrames.asm). It will be used with
	  PTK-Prowiz soon. Documentation for UadeNewGetInfo() can be read
	  from amigasrc/score/score.s, see function "uade_new_get_info".
	
2007-02-03  Heikki Orsila <heikki.orsila@iki.fi>
	- Disassembled Andy Silvas Infogrames replayer, added a work-around
	  list for Gobliins 2 songs to fix tempo. Thanks to Sven Hesse of
	  ScummVM project for letting us know of the tempo problem.
	  The next thing to do is go through all Infogrames games with UAE
	  and record the tempo value for each song? Any volunteers?-)

2007-01-30  Michael Doering <mld@users.sourceforge.net>
	- Changed Scrollbar policy for audacious modinfo to avoid
          ugly line breaking in hexmode

2007-01-25  Heikki Orsila <heikki.orsila@iki.fi>
	* UADE 2.05 (It came from the Paula)
	- This release workarounds scheduler features of some 2.6.x Linux
	  kernels. IPC method was changed to use sockets instead of pipes,
	  which significantly reduces buffer underruns. This is really the
	  only change affecting scheduling! Weird.

2007-01-24  Heikki Orsila <heikki.orsila@iki.fi>
	- Fixed compilation for platforms that lack memmem(), such as Mac.
	  The compilation bug was introduced at 2007-01-21 when unixipc
	  and unixsupport were merged.

2007-01-22  Michael Doering <mld@users.sourceforge.net>
	- Fixed songinfo for mods detected as Protracker compatible

2007-01-21  Heikki Orsila <heikki.orsila@iki.fi>
	- Merge unixipc.c and unixsupport.c. Modularise uadecore spawn into
	  unixsupport.c.
	- Move from pipe based IPC communication to UNIX socket based
	  communication. This solves a scheduling problem for some 2.6.x Linux
	  kernels.

2007-01-21  Heikki Orsila <heikki.orsila@iki.fi>
	* UADE 2.04 (Defective by Design .org)
	- Added Jochen Hippel ST player (hst.* files)
	- Added Quartet player from Don Adan / Wanted Team (qpa.* files)
	- Updated Mark Cookset replayer with a new version from Don Adan of
	  Wanted Team
	- It's now possible to command an eagleplayer listed in
	  eagleplayer.conf to ignore file type check. This is useful
	  with the CustomMade replayer as it rejects some valid song files.
	  See the change log entry from 2007-01-02 and the man page
	  about song.conf and eagleplayer.conf.
	- Cygwin work-around (locking on song contents db is broken). Does
	  NOT affect unixes.
	- Amiga memory size can now be configured properly from ~/.uade2/uaerc.
	  This is useful with big sound files (rare).
	- Fixed the sinc filter, it had a bug that made it less accurate
	- Man page updates about filters
	- GCC 4.x clean ups
	- Small bug fixes. The default uade.conf had a deprecated option
	  in comments. It was removed.
	- Updated installation instructions

2007-01-18  Heikki Orsila <heikki.orsila@iki.fi>
	- Fixed a bug in default uade.conf. "headphone" option for the
	  uade.conf was obsoleted at 2006-05-13, the new option name
	  became "headphones". The backward compatibility is retained
	  again and thus "headphone" option will work to some future.
	- Fixed several missing cvs sticky bits (-kb) in players/ dir

2007-01-15  Michael Doering <mld@users.sourceforge.net>
	- Made "detect_format_by_content" parameter for modfiles default.
	  This way only true Amiga 4ch mod files now get played.
	- Added Quartet player from Don Adan / Wanted Team. It recognizes
	  QPA.* files.

2007-01-12  Heikki Orsila <heikki.orsila@iki.fi>
	- Added "ignore_player_check" option for eagleplayer.conf and
	  song.conf. It is useful with bad eagleplayers and rips. This
	  feature was requested for use with CustomMade player and therefore
	  this option will also be made default for that player. See the
	  new eagleplayer.conf.

2007-01-11  Antti S. Lankila <alankila@bel.fi>
	- Correct some ancient mistakes in uade123.1, regarding filter
	  operation. For instance the LED filter center frequency was
	  reported halved due to an earlier mistake in graph drawing

2006-12-22  Heikki Orsila <heikki.orsila@iki.fi>
	- Added Jochen Hippel ST player from Don Adan / Wanted Team. It
	  recognizes HST.* files
	- Replaced old Mark Cooksey replayer with a new version from
	  Don Adan / Wanted Team

2006-12-07  Antti S. Lankila <alankila@bel.fi>
	- Remove uadecore with make clean

2006-12-03  Antti S. Laknila <alankila@bel.fi>
	- Fixed a strict aliasing warning that occured with GCC 4.1 in
	  newcpu.h

2006-12-01  Heikki Orsila <heikki.orsila@iki.fi>
	- Memory size of Amiga can now be increased over 2 MiB by editing
	  the uaerc file (e.g. ~/.uade2/uaerc). The variable named chipmem_size
	  should be edited. Allocated memory for the amiga is determined by
	     chipmem_size * 512 KiB
	  By default, chipmem_size = 4 -> 2 MiB of memory. This variable can
	  be set up to 16 (8 MiB of memory).

2006-11-26  Heikki Orsila <heikki.orsila@iki.fi>
	- Updated instructions about -x option in uade123 and its man page.

2006-10-28  Antti S. Lankila <alankila@bel.fi>
	- Due to me misunderstanding the Kaiser window beta parameter,
	  the BLEP tables for sinc synthesis were set to attenuate aliasing
	  only for 40 dB instead of the target 80 dB.

2006-10-24  Heikki Orsila <heikki.orsila@iki.fi>
	- No locking with Cygwin -> uade is dangerous with songdb.

2006-10-02  Heikki Orsila <heikki.orsila@iki.fi>
	- Updated INSTALL.readme to include more dependencies (pkg-config
	  and sed) and tips for Mac OS X compiling (workarounds)

2006-08-27  Heikki Orsila <heikki.orsila@iki.fi>
	* UADE 2.03 (Microsoft punishment)
	- Added song.conf support to set song specific attributes for 
	  playback, such as ntsc, blank, filtering etc. See the man
	  page. An example, one may add following line to ~/.uade2/song.conf
	  to make fred.hybris_light always timeout on 200 seconds:
	    md5=60f3bb11cc1bacaf77d7c16d13361844 broken_song_end timeout=200 comment FRED.Hybris_Light
	  This need not be added manually, one can just issue:
	    uade123 --set=broken_song_end --set=timeout=200 FRED.Hybris_Light
	  and afterwards uade will always play the song correctly.
	  Similarly, one can fix volume gain for some songs:
	    uade123 --set=gain=2 foo
	  To reset all options for a given song, do:
	    uade123 --set= foo
	- Fixed PAL audio synthesis frequency (inaudible)
	- --interpolator=x is now --resampler=x because the function of
	  interpolators was actually resampling.
	- Only A500 and A1200 filters are now supported and A500 is the
	  default.
	- Added Play time database support for uade123
	- Compatibility fixes
	- Lots of bug fixes
	- Improvements in uade123 UI (press i or I for info on song)
	- Improved file magic support for some formats (P61A, Fuzzac, ...)
	- Hacky NTSC mode support available now. Use --ntsc or ntsc
	  directive in uade123. Also works per-song with song.conf.
	  One can now make specific songs be played in NTSC mode by
	  programming song.conf with proper values. One can issue:
	    uade123 --set=ntsc dw.FooBar
	  or put a line to ~/.uade2/song.conf:
	    md5=225bbb405433c7c05fe10b99b8e088ff ntsc comment dw.AlfredChicken
	- One can force protracker replayer to use VBlank timing with many
	  ways, see the man page on section EAGLEPLAYER OPTIONS. For example,
	  do:
	    uade123 -x vblank mod.FooBar
	- Enhancements in PTK-Prowiz. Protracker version is now selectable
	  between 3.0b, 2.3a and 1.0c. See the man page section EAGLEPLAYERS
	  OPTIONS. This option is not yet guaranteed to be 100% but may
	  fix some immediate problems with some songs.. These settings
	  may also be recorded to song.conf so that one only has to give
	  these parameters once. Example:
	    uade123 -x type:pt10c mod.TheClassicProtrackerVersionedSong
	  btw. uade is probably the first mod player for non-amigas that
	  has a direct version support for protrackers.
	- Improved some players
	- Titles in audacious and xmms plugins on the playlist are now
	  programmable with uade.conf. The default is
	    song_title %F %X [%P]
	  This displays filename, subsong (if more than one) and player.
	  See SONG TITLE SPECIFICATION section in the man page. There's a
	  small help in the uade.conf too.
	- Significant code refactorizations
	- Fixed a memory leak issue (see Change log on 2006-04-15)
	- Added Dirk Bialluch format support by Don Adan/Wanted Team

2006-07-27  Heikki Orsila <heikki.orsila@iki.fi>
	- Removed -fno-strength-reduce from src/Makefile.in. Some old
	  GCC 2.x versions had bugged strength reduce, but it shouldn't
	  matter anymore. Maybe the compiler will produce better code
	  without this. AHX.cruisin showed approx 3% speedup :) Thanks
	  to alankila for pointing out use of this flag.

2006-07-17  Heikki Orsila <heikki.orsila@iki.fi>
	- Fixed a segfault bug in songdb caused by recent changes to add
	  subsong volume normalisation info to contentdb. Segfaults were
	  catched in several places due to uninitialized vplist in
	  struct uade_content.

2006-07-02  Heikki Orsila <heikki.orsila@iki.fi>
	- Merged an initial version of volume normalization effect from
	  alankila.
	- Split song.conf and contentdb related functionality away from
	  eagleplayer.c to songdb.c.

2006-06-30  Heikki Orsila <heikki.orsila@iki.fi>
	- Work-arounded signedness warnings with GCC4 in src/frontends/common/

2006-06-23  Heikki Orsila <heikki.orsila@iki.fi>
	- Fix sinc resampler to support --filter=none (alankila)
	- Optimize sinc_handler() inner-loop by avoiding unnecessary
	  indexing (alankila)

2006-06-22  Heikki Orsila <heikki.orsila@iki.fi>
	- Separated accumulator and sinc resamplers into separate functions
	  in src/audio.c.
	- Removed "anti" name from resampler list. "anti" has been the
	  "default" for a long time already.
	- Change FIR convolution of sinc into bandlimited step synthesis.
	  Filters are applied directly by the BLEPs. Warning, sinc and
	  filtering are now integrated together so they can not be
	  changed separately (breaking modular development idea). The
	  default resampler does not suffer from this modularity problem
	  and it is still the recommended resampler. (alankila)

2006-06-18  Heikki Orsila <heikki.orsila@iki.fi>
	- Added play time database saving support into uade123.

2006-05-22  Heikki Orsila <heikki.orsila@iki.fi>
	- Changed --magic to --detect-format-by-content and changed
	  corresponding "content_detection" directive in eagleplayer.conf and
	  uade.conf to "detect_format_by_content". Changed --no-song-end to
	  "--no-ep-end-detect".

2006-05-20  Heikki Orsila <heikki.orsila@iki.fi>
	- Changed default input file to be /dev/tty instead of stdin for
	  uade123. Also, failing terminal setup (input file is not a tty)
	  is not a fatal error.
	- Added a warning to eagleplayer.conf parsing for the situation
	  that user has removed all prefixes from an eagleplayer. It makes
	  all kind of detection (including content detection) unusable.
	  If you don't want to detect a particular file type by name
	  extensions, add "content_detection" option for the line in
	  eagleplayer.conf. But note that there isn't content detection
	  for all formats. For example, adding "content_detection" for
	  Thomas Hermann player will make all Thomas Hermann songs
	  unplayable because there is no content detection for it.

2006-05-19  Heikki Orsila <heikki.orsila@iki.fi>
	- Added Gryzors (Nicholas Franck <gryzor@club-internet.fr>)
	  Protracker converter source code into CVS. See
	  amigasrc/players/tracker/converter/README.txt for copyright and
	  licensing information. Thanks to Stuart Caie for leading us
	  to the distribution terms (we did have the source before :-)

2006-05-18  Heikki Orsila <heikki.orsila@iki.fi>
	- Added p5x and p6x file extensions for The Player 5.x/6.x to
	  eagleplayer.conf (Stuart Caie requested it)
	- Added "P50A" four letter magic detection to amifilemagic.c

2006-05-17  Michael Doering <mld@users.sourceforge.net>
	- Removed deprecated <audacious/configfile.h> from audacious
	  plugin. Thanks to Joker for the report.

2006-05-16  Michael Doering <mld@users.sourceforge.net>
	- Raised length of extension[] in uade_analyze_file from 11 to 16,
	  which caused the xmms and audacious plugin to segfault on
	  very long prefixes (such as mod15_st-iv) in eagleplayer.conf.

2006-06-15  Heikki Orsila <heikki.orsila@iki.fi>
	- Added "-x y" to set eagleplayer options more conveniently. It's
	  now possible to do: uade123 -x type:pt11b mod.foo. -x can be
	  used multiple times on the same command line.

2006-05-15  Michael Doering <mld@users.sourceforge.net>
	- PTK-Prowiz now uses the epopt config system. You can set options
          such as "vblank" and/or "type:" on a song base with the uade123
          "--set=xyz" command line parameter or edit uade.conf or song.conf
          manually. For valid protracker types: check the uade123 man page.
          Please test. I hope I didn't break anything.
	- Changed Protracker and compatible tag in amifilemagic. It seems
	  it was too long for xmms/audacious and crashed. Odd.
 
2006-05-13  Heikki Orsila <heikki.orsila@iki.fi>
	- Merged man page update from alankila, explaining filter and
	  resampling features
	- Merged headphones 2 effect patch from alankila, making it sample
	  rate independent
	- Added --version to uade123
	- Cleaned up frontends with respect to configuration management.
	  Initial configuration loading is made in uade_load_initial_config()
	  in all frontends.
	- Fixed song.conf locking
	- Fixed recursive mode song.conf option setting. Try:
	  uade123 -r --set=gain=2 songdir

2006-05-12  Michael Doering <mld@users.sourceforge.net>
	- Audacious modinfo GTK-2.8's assertion error fixed by "porting"
	  the legacy gdk_font_load/gtk_text to gtk2's tag, viewport,
	  buffer system.
	- Worked around gtk2's assumption any text has to be clean UTF-8
	  which obviously will break when displaying binaryhexdumps or
	  Amiga locale strings.

2006-05-11  Heikki Orsila <heikki.orsila@iki.fi>
	- Updated documentation to reflect implementation.
	- Added support for eagleplayer/song specific eagleplayer options.
	  Use epopt=x in eagleplayer.conf and song.conf. Look at the
	  man page section "EAGLEPLAYER OPTIONS" for valid options.

2006-05-09  Heikki Orsila <heikki.orsila@iki.fi>
	- Added information about sample rate into effects API.
	- Fixed a race condition for Audacious and XMMS plugins.
	  A shared static buffer was not locked for file magic detection
	  in eagleplayer.c:analyze_file_format().
	- Fixed a bug in eagleplayer.c:analyze_file_format() that might
	  have caused a partial read for file to be detected.
	- Fixed a buffer overrun bug in uade.c:uade_get_amiga_message().
	  With AMIGAMSG_GET_INFO request, the eagleplayer could
	  cause a slight overrun of the amiga memory to uade data memory.
	  The attacker could not however choose the string to be written
	  over the bounds.

2006-05-07  Heikki Orsila <heikki.orsila@iki.fi>
	- Improved filters to work on arbitrary frequency (alankila)
	- Removed A500S and A1200S filters. For compatibility, they're now
	  aliased to A500 and A1200.
	- Moved computation of audio emulation parameters away from
	  init_sound() to audio_set_rate(). init_sound() calls
	  audio_set_rate().
	- It's now possible to use frequency directive in uade.conf to
	  set playback frequency. But watch out, it can cause bugs
	  and sound quality degradation.
	- Now only two models (FILTER_MODEL_(A500|A1200)) exist in
	  amigafilter.h.
	- Code cleanups
	- Renamed interpolator to be resampler in command line options
	  and configuration files. Use --resampler=x instead of
	  --interpolator=x.
	- Fixed IIR filter not to waste CPU time with denormal numbers.
	  This idea was presented to us by Antti Huovilainen, thanks.
	  Try playing BD.Mickey_mouse with an older version and see how
	  much cpu it takes with A500 filter. The new version is one
	  quarter CPU time on an AMD64 machine (alankila)
	- Optimized event handling in include/events.h by removing
	  redundant vsynctime check that relied upon processor/OS
	  specific timers (that we've removed long ago).

2006-05-06  Heikki Orsila <heikki.orsila@iki.fi>
	- Added two util functions into uadeipc.c. They are uade_send_u32()
	  and uade_send_two_u32s().
	- Started changes towards changeable output frequency. You can
	  experiment with --freq=x but filter emulation only works for
	  44,1 kHz at the moment. Note that filter emulation always has an
	  effect on sound.

2006-05-05  Heikki Orsila <heikki.orsila@iki.fi>
	- Fixed --filter=x and --force-led=y to work again.

2006-05-02  Michael Doering <mld@users.sourceforge.net>
	- Fixed crash due to uninitialized pointer to subsong scale in seek
	  window for xmms and auda plugin. 
	  Seems the UI got into a race condition when trying to update the
	  scale belonging to the seek window and the pointer for the seek
	  window was there, while the scale wasn't ready. This happend for
	  very short subsongs only...
	- Added NTK/STK detection to modinfo
	- Check for Dirk Bialluch songs in amifilemagic.

2006-05-02  Heikki Orsila <heikki.orsila@iki.fi>
	- Fixed a small bug that allows resetting song.conf options from
	  the command line. Use 'uade123 --set= foo' to reset options.

2006-05-01  Heikki Orsila <heikki.orsila@iki.fi>
	- Changing to a previous song is now possible in uade123. Try
	  pressing '<'. -z option now means randomizing the playlist
	  order before playing, but random play mode (press 's') does
	  randomizing on the fly. Both alternatives support seeking to
	  previous song in the same way, but seeking to next song will
	  always be random in random play mode (not with -z).
	- Added --repeat option into uade123 to play playlist over and
	  over again.

2006-04-30  Heikki Orsila <heikki.orsila@iki.fi>
	- It's now possible to set options into song.conf by using uade123
	  directly. This is not the final feature, only a step towards
	  a more usable feature. Try:
	    # uade123 --set="gain=2" foo
	  It should add the associated entry into ~/.uade2/song.conf.
	  Eventually uade123 should be used like:
	    # uade123 --set --gain=2 foo

2006-04-29  Heikki Orsila <heikki.orsila@iki.fi>
	- Changed hexdump of module/player to show 2 KiBs of text.
	- Fixed some memory leaks in eagleplayer.c and songinfo.c.
	- Removed doc/eagleplayer.conf and doc/song.conf. doc/uade123.1 is
	  the authorative documentation for all configuration files.
	- Many uade song attribute and configuration management changes.
	- Added broken song end directive for eagleplayers and songs.
	  To work-around a defective timeout logics in song.conf you could
	  add a following line to your song.conf:
	     md5=60f3bb11cc1bacaf77d7c16d13361844 broken_song_end timeout=200 comment FRED.Hybris_Light
	- Marked song end detection of FRED format as defective in
	  eagleplayer.conf:
	      Fred    prefixes=fred    broken_song_end
	- Unified eagleplayer.conf and song.conf settings. See uade123
	  man page for those options.

2006-04-28  Heikki Orsila <heikki.orsila@iki.fi>
	- Fixed another config bug introduced by last config refactorization.
	  Filter type could not be set from config file in uade123. The bug
	  did not happen on Audacious/XMMS plugins.
	- uade123 -v now prints the uade.conf and song.conf files that were
	  loaded.

2006-04-28  Michael Doering <mld@users.sourceforge.net>
	- Fixed bug in Soundtracker 31 instruments check introduced
	  by fixing the misdetection of a digibooster as protracker mod which
	  was introduced by easing accepting mods with bad length...
	  See a pattern there, folks?!?
	- Along the way, added a distinction between Soundtracker 2.5/
	  Noisetracker1.0 and Soundtracker 2.4. ST2.5/NT1.0 obviously shared
	  the same replay by Kaktus & Mahoney, while ST2.4 was still based on
	  the old 2.3 replay by Unknown and Mnemotron (using repeat offset in
	  bytes).

2006-04-27  Michael Doering <mld@users.sourceforge.net>
	- Fixed misdetection of a digibooster mod as protracker in
	  amifilemagic.
	- Fortified modplayer checks against amifilemagic's new policy
	  to accept modfiles with trailing garbage...

2006-04-26  Heikki Orsila <heikki.orsila@iki.fi>
	- Fixed panning, gain and recursive mode to work again. The problem
	  was the new configuration management system. Command line options
	  were not merged into used options. Also, even if they were merged,
	  they would happen before effects were set ;) Sorry. Fixed now.
	- Improved gain effect. It can now clip samples if an overflow
	  happens.
	- Improved song.conf settings. It now supports all but two
	  options. See doc/song.conf.

2006-04-21  Michael Doering <mld@users.sourceforge.net>
	- Fixed detection bug triptodestroy.mod in PTK-Prowiz. Thanks to
	  Joker for the report.
	  The mod uses very large instruments with loops which rolled over
	  to negative checking instrument sizes in words and when large
	  enough. Stupid bug. Stupid me. :-)
	- Replaced \t with white spaces. This might fix Joker's bug report
	  about garbled output in modinfo for audacious.
	- Fixed audacious crash, when trying to access fileinfo while not
	  playing a song... Bug was simple we did't have uadesong struct.
	  get_cur_subsong, get_max_subsong and get_min_ subsong was trying
	  read from that struct even when idle and uade went up in a blaze...
	  Now checking towards uadsong struct exists and all is nice
	- Fixed the Audacious crash fix. It contained a race condition with
	  respect to the NULL pointer. Also fixed the XMMS plugin. (shd)

2006-04-19  Michael Doering <mld@users.sourceforge.net>
	- Added new replayer for the Dirk Bialluch format by
	  Don Adan/Wanted Team.
	- Amended Startrekker/Audiosculpture detection in amifilemagic again.

2006-04-18  Heikki Orsila <heikki.orsila@iki.fi>
	- Fixed a bug in memmem() replacement. If needle length was zero,
	  it returned NULL, but glibc would return pointer to haystack.

2006-04-15  Michael Doering <mld@users.sourceforge.net>
	- Fixed bug in sanity check in pt_karplusstrong effect (e8x) in
	  mod player. (thanks Heikki)
	- Disabled Effect E8x for Protracker 2.3a, 1.1b and 1.0c compatibility
	  mode in PTK-Prowiz.
	  E.g. Playing mod.cyberlogik as PTK3.0 will result in timing bugs,
	  playing it as PTK2.3a will play ok.
	- Fixed a very serious memory leak issue. Each played song that was
	  read into memory was leaked. My chip collection is 230 MiB and
	  after running
	      valgrind -zr -t1 --enable-timeouts -f /dev/null /chips
	  I noticed a huge chunk of mem leaked :( Now it's fixed. (shd)

2006-04-14  Heikki Orsila <heikki.orsila@iki.fi>
	- Refactored and changed amifilemagic.c. Changed tracker type magic
	  values into enums. A warning about differing file size and
	  calculated file size for protracker modules is given if one of
	  two conditions happen:
	    - uade123 is run in verbose mode (-v)
	    - xmms or audacious plugin starts to play file
	- Refactored configuration code
	- Fixed a subsong/total timeout bug in xmms and audacious plugins.
	  Always ends directive was not obeyed.

2006-04-13  Heikki Orsila <heikki.orsila@iki.fi>
	- Committed a programmable option for displaying song titles on
	  playlist. Try setting
	    song_title %F %X [%P]
	  to uade.conf.
	- Reverted xmms buffer underrun fix that was ported to audacious
	  plugin. With produce_audio() one does not need to wait for
	  buffer_free(). (shd)
	  [Comment: it still locks up here :-\] (mld)
	- Added songtitle feature to audacious plugin and uade.conf (mld)
	- Added #include <songinfo.h> to audacious plugin and removed some
	  unused variables.
	- Added a work-around against ALSA output plugin into XMMS plugin
	  which avoids to old subsong change blocking bug. Now sleeping is
	  hardlimited to 5 secs. If work-around is activated, you will see:
	  	UADE: blocking work-around activated.
	  on stderr. It seems like snd_pcm_state(pcm) in ALSA output plugin
	  never comes out of SND_PCM_STATE_RUNNING.
	- Set song_title default to %F %X [%P]
	- Fixed all xmms and audacious plugin symbols to be non-exportable
	  symbols. The get_iplugin_info() remains the only exportable
	  symbol. 'objcopy -G get_iplugin_info foo.so' should do it, right?

2006-04-12  Heikki Orsila <heikki.orsila@iki.fi>
	- Fixed configure script to handle uade.pc file correctly in the
	  situation of '--user'.
	- Added a user warning to amifilemagic.c about truncated protracker
	  modules.
	- Reverted Michaels change partially. Audacious and XMMS plugins will
	  not show song name that is obtained from the module because it
	  is unreliable. This will be made configurable in the future.
	- Fixed a potential bug in XMMS plugin. If maximum free audio buffers
	  was less than 4088 bytes, uade plugin would refuse to write
	  anything. This was noticed because XMMS wouldn't recover from
	  a buffer underrun in ALSA mmap mode. The output plugin would
	  not increase the amount of free buffers even if time passes.
	  XMMS 1.2.10 ALSA output plugin (or alsa library) is still buggy.
	- Ported shd's xmms buffer underrun fix to audacious (mld)
	- Changed user warning about truncated protracker modules in
	  amifilemagic to produce less false positives. (mld)

2006-04-11  Michael Doering <mld@users.sourceforge.net>
	- Fixed my crap indentation in audacious plugin
	- Sync'd xmms and audacious playlist display
	- Fixed possible changing current subsong > maximal subsong
	  in audacious plugin.

2006-04-10  Heikki Orsila <heikki.orsila@iki.fi>
	- --no-song-end is now aliased to -n in uade123
	- Fixed bug in ArtOfNoise8 replayer end routine. (mld)
	- Added Songtitle to ArtOfNoise 4V/8V players (mld)
	- Display "Guru Meditation" error in audacious playlist for a song
	  that crashed uadecore. :-) (mld).
	- Fixed bug updating the playtime in audacious playlist (mld)

2006-04-09  Heikki Orsila <heikki.orsila@iki.fi>
	- Code refactorization to unify configuration, effect and song
	  attribute handling among all frontends.
	- Added memmem() replacement for operating systems not having it.
	- Added uade.pc for pkg-config.
	- Upgraded MED/OctaMED replay to v7.0, using Fastmem replay if
	  available and needed by the song (long samples :-) (mld)
	- DigiBooster player now reports songname. (mld)
	- Fixed ommited pointer in MED/Octamed fastmem replay detection.
	  (mld)

2006-04-06  Heikki Orsila <heikki.orsila@iki.fi>
	- Added a small README file
	- Moved some effect related configuration issues to
	  src/frontends/common/ so that they're not reimplemented in all
	  frontends. See src/frontends/common/uadeconf.c function
	  uade_enable_conf_effects().
	- Use of uade_enable_conf_effects() in audacious plugin (mld)
	- Disabled debug messages in Audacious and XMMS plugins
	- Removed debug message about song.conf not found. It's perfectly
	  valid that song.conf does not exist anywhere.
	- Cleaned songinfo.c. Added a common implementation of read_be_u16/u32
	  to src/include/uadeutils.h, which is now used from songinfo.c and
	  amifilemagic.c. Changed length types to size_t. Made find_tag()
	  more generic and made it use memmem() function.
        - Added Heikki's dpiutil to songinfo for CUST.* songs. (mld)

2006-04-05  Michael Doering <mld@users.sourceforge.net>
	- PTK-Prowiz: changed opcodes beq, sf to  seq on Heikkis advice.
	- Tiny Protracker player compatibility change when calling
	  playvoice.
	- Nicer playlist entries for Audcious plugin:
	  title (cur/max) - [Format]

2006-04-03  Heikki Orsila <heikki.orsila@iki.fi>
	- Implemented NTSC mode support. It can be buggy and it will not
	  affect some players at all (those which set CIA tempo by
	  themselves). NTSC mode can detected in eagleplayers by reading
	  $212(execbase) aka VBlankFrequency(execbase). It's a byte
	  with value 50 (PAL) or 60 (NTSC):
	    move.l 4.w,a6
	    cmp.b #60,$212(a6)
	    beq   is_an_ntsc_system
	    * pal system
	- Changed Timing configuration in players/env/PTK-Prowiz.cfg
	  from CIA <-> VBI/NTSC to CIA <-> VBI. (mld)
	- Mod player now honours pal/ntsc setting automatically. (mld)
	- Fixed stupid *oops* in mod player reading cia timing from config
	  file.
	- Added ntsc option uade.conf. (mld)

2006-04-02  Heikki Orsila <heikki.orsila@iki.fi>
	- Fixed P61A detection (introduced by mlds change sometime ago).
	  src/frontends/common/amifilemagic.c had "P60A" as the pattern
	  for Player 6.1, but obviously it should be "P61A".
	- Improved the man page.

2006-03-31  Michael Doering <mld@users.sourceforge.net>
	- Changed DMAWait to dtg_DMAWait and add dtg_Timer support
	  to DIGI-Booster
	- DIGI-booster songinfo now matches modfiles songinfo.

2006-03-30  Michael Doering <mld@users.sourceforge.net>
	- Small check for Fuzzac Packer in amifilemagic.

2006-03-27  Michael Doering <mld@users.sourceforge.net>
	- Renamed XANN-Packer to XANN-Player, following Sylvain 'Asle'
	  Chipeaux' suggestion.
	- Merged Funkok saftey check from EP2.04 to protracker player...

2006-03-25  Heikki Orsila <heikki.orsila@iki.fi>
	- Added a new action key into uade123. 'i' will print module info
	  and 'I' will print a hex dump of a head of the module.

2006-03-23  Michael Doering <mld@users.sourceforge.net>
	- Sync'd songinfo for modfiles with the more verbose appearance of
	  Asle's ModInfo v2.31 appearance... It displays now sample sizes,
	  volume, finetune, loop start and loop size, too.
	- Added yet some more tiny differences between Protracker 2.3 and 3.0
	  compatibility mode for completeness... (set sample_num in pt_plvskip,
	  and n_period in pt_doretrig).
	  These changes might have no effect on the replay quality like e.g.
	  earlier mentioned Updatefunk calling difference or volume setting,
	  though.

2006-03-21  Michael Doering <mld@users.sourceforge.net>
	- Small protacker replayer config file parsing fix...

2006-03-20  Heikki Orsila <heikki.orsila@iki.fi>
	- Fixed slight bugs in build system. Architecture specific CFLAGS
	  were missing from xmms and audacious frontends. Also, those flags
	  will be the last flags always so that they can be used for
	  overriding other options.
	- Made debug flags really optional. They can be turned off with
	  --no-debug (for configure).

2006-03-20  Michael Doering <mld@users.sourceforge.net>
	- Figured out the period multiplier issue. It was a bug in my
	  brain. *g*
	- Forgot to add notecut volume setting for protracker 2.3 and below.
	  This is now fixed.
	- Set the default playback style to Protracker 3.0b.
	- Added an experimental hybrid protracker setup: 9.
	  Effects are done ptk2.3a style, volume setting like 3.0.
	  This fixes some pops and clicks which even the original
	  protacker 2.3a replay and below had.

2006-03-17  Michael Doering <mld@users.sourceforge.net>
	- Enhanced compatibilty concerning protracker 2.3a/1.1b(fixed),
	  2.1a/1.1b, 1.0c and Prottracker 3.0b concerning access of
	  the periodtable while using the effects.
	  It's astonishing in how many ways the protracker replays
	  differ... :-)
	  E.g. Protracker 3.0b (like Noisetracker)  uses a multiplication of
	  37*2 for all effects to get the right period. Protracker 2.3a and
	  the socalled bugfixed 1.1b replay use a value of 36*2 (like the
	  old Soundtracker)
	  Last but least ptk 1.0c, the original ptk1.1b and ptk2.1a use
	  one or the other value for some effects...
	  All in all, it's a mess and we have 4 different setups in our
	  protracker config file :-)
	- Temporarily disabled the period multiplier hack mentioned above
	  because it borked on some tunes.
	- Added "update volume when skip/hold note" for protracker 2.3 and
	  below. Protracker 3.0 doesn't do it.

2006-03-16  Heikki Orsila <heikki.orsila@iki.fi>
	- Changed PAL audio synthesis frequency to be exactly 3546895 Hz. It
	  was 3541200 Hz before. The old value was totally synchronous with
	  video hw. Changing this does not affect anything else than audio.
	  The new value is from the hardware reference manual.

2006-03-16  Michael Doering <mld@users.sourceforge.net>
	- Compatibility for PTK-Prowiz can now be set to play files like
	  Protracker 3.0b, 2.3a or 1.0c.
	  INFO: Files being played as PT1.0c will have a different vibrato
	  depth, and use funk_repeat effect instead of the invert loop effect
	  which might break all mods composed with later protrackers.
	- Added support for the different ways Protrackers 1.0, 2.3 and 3.0
	  updated periods.

2006-03-14  Heikki Orsila <heikki.orsila@iki.fi>
	* UADE 2.02 (Muhammad pictures)
	- Fixed a bug in xmms plugin that cut off sound data from the end of
	  a song.
	- New Sierra AGI player by Don Adan / Wanted Team
	- Better support for old sonic arranger files.
	- Improved file type detection on many formats.
	- Debugger improvements (see 'c' and 'i' commands)
	- Added --buffer-time=x option for uade123 to set audio buffer
	  length in milliseconds.
	- A configuration file was added for PTK-Prowiz (that plays protracker
	  and clones) to set compatibility to either protracker v3.0b or
	  v2.3a. Please edit file: players/ENV/EaglePlayer/EP-PTK-Prowiz.cfg.
	- More KDE integration: support for kfmexec wrapper.
	- Fixed many bugs.
	- Many other changes :-)

2006-03-12  Heikki Orsila <heikki.orsila@iki.fi>
	- Changed various uade123 parameters. -k and -K have been changed
	  to one option:
	    -k x or --keys=x, where x is 0 or 1 (disabling and enabling action
	    keys).
	  --no-filter has been removed. Use --filter=none instead.

2006-03-10  Heikki Orsila <heikki.orsila@iki.fi>
	- Fixed some compiler warnings. Using %u to print unsigned ints :)

2006-03-01  Heikki Orsila <heikki.orsila@iki.fi>
	- Reverted mlds work-around to avoid subsong change lockups.
	- Did a potential fix for the XMMS plugin lockup bug. However, I
	  do not have a test case for this. The problem was, I think, that
	  play_loop() called uade_lock(), then called
	  uade_gui_subsong_changed(), then gtk called some function,
	  which would eventually call get_next_subsong() which would
	  try to re-take the mutex by uade_lock() -> deadlock.
	  * THIS THEORY WAS WRONG.
	- Merged a patch from Martin Jeppensen to rename some eagleplayers
	  to better names.

2006-02-28  Heikki Orsila <heikki.orsila@iki.fi>
	- Fixed -m option for uade123. "uade123 -m file" would only print help
	  but not play the file.

2006-02-17  Michael Doering <mld@users.sourceforge.net>
	- Added some missing file extensions for the KDE mimelnk.
	- Use of kfmexec wrapper in KDE mimelnk for easy ftp:// http://,
	  smb://, zip:// etc. support under KDE/Konqueror.
	- Added install script for KDE users in  /src/frontents/uade123/KDE.
	  Now playing Amiga music is just one click away from you ;-)

2006-02-15  Michael Doering <mld@users.sourceforge.net>
	- NTSC Flag in config file ENV:eagleplayer/ for PTK-Prowiz affecting
	  Sound, Noisetracker, Startrekker and Protracker (vblank) added.
	  Normal Pro- and Fastracker are not affected.
	  Info: it's not a real ntsc mode in emulation but just calculating
	  the CIAA timer to use a value ~ 7.15Mhz, 60khz, 125bpm on PAL
	  machines...
	  It's a cludge I know :)

2006-02-14  Heikki Orsila <heikki.orsila@iki.fi>
	- Fixed /dev/urandom detection. Using test -c rather than test -e.
	  Test -c is more compatible and more exact too.
	- Worked around random lock ups when switching very short subsongs
	  with the xmms subsong changer (mld)
	- Config file for PTK-Prowiz' Protracker engine added to set the
	  way _Protracker_ mods are played. There's currently two values: 0
	  for Protracker 3.0b like, 1 for Protracker 2.3A like (for anyone
	  interested: funkrepeat is updated before parsing the extended fx :)
	  Differences are probl. not audible but Latter is currently the
	  default. If it breaks a mod file, you can savely turn back to
	  "0" (mld)

2006-02-13  Heikki Orsila <heikki.orsila@iki.fi>
	- Fixed uade123 to accept -k and -K switches. Their meaning is now
	  changed. '-k' disables action keys and '-K' enables.

2006-02-10  Michael Doering <mld@users.sourceforge.net>
	- A new email alias. ;)
	- Cosmetical change in name from 32 to 31 instr. for Soundtracker II
	  in PTK-Prowiz.

2006-02-08  Michael Doering <mldoering@gmx.net>
	- Updated mod2ogg.sh to set encoding quality (Giulio Canevari).

2006-02-07  Michael Doering <mldoering@gmx.net>
	- Put new Sierra AGI player by Don Adan/Wanted Team into players dir.

2006-02-02  Heikki Orsila <heikki.orsila@iki.fi>
	- Cleaned up gensound.h. It contained unuseful external variables
	  such as sample16s_handler and sample_handler.
	- Improved mod detection in amifilemagic and Protracker replayer for
	  Protracker compatible mods using effects 5,6,7 and 9. (mld)
	- Quick "work around" of a lock up with the subsong seek popup and very
	  short subsongs in audacious plugin. Needs further investigation
	  though. Some kind of race condition, I think. (mld)
	- Reintroduced produce_audio(); to audacious plugin for the freshly
	  released Audacious 0.2 at http://audacious-media-player.org (mld)

2006-02-01  Michael Doering <mldoering@gmx.net>
	- Changed association of jp file extension to Jason Page New.
	- Added simple detection for Jason Page old in amifilemagic.
	- Added alternative Jason Page Player for one file Jason Page New
	  files (Thanks dom from the legacy.de for the report).
	- Changed HIP, HIPC and HIP7 to SOG, SOC and S7G prefix in
	  amifilemagic.

2006-01-31  Heikki Orsila <heikki.orsila@iki.fi>
	- Fixed song length database bug in the XMMS plugin. The XMMS plugin
	  didn't use the correct md5sum in struct uade_song, instead it used
	  the old and useless array called curmd5[] which was an empty
	  string.
	- Continued to move common variables in frontends to struct uade_song.
	- Fixed instrument name len in songinfo for mods. (mld)

2006-01-25  Michael Doering <mldoering@gmx.net>
	- Added Turbo/Infect's SonicArranger Player for "old" sa.* files
	- Added experimental filedetection for two different
	  Sonicarranger_pc types...

2006-01-24  Michael Doering <mldoering@gmx.net>
	- Synced audacious plugin with xmms plugin and changed back
	  to support the current stable audacious 0.1.2.
	  The audacious supporting "produce_audio()" will be supported as
	  soon as there's a stable release... (mld)
	- Ported songinfo for Wanted Team song formats [e.g BSS, DL, FP...]
	- Fixed mod title display in songinfo

2006-01-22  Heikki Orsila <heikki.orsila@iki.fi>
        - Added a new option to uade.conf: buffer_time x. buffer_time x in
	  uade.conf sets audio buffer length to x milliseconds. This can
	  be used to avoid buffer underruns on some systems. Beware that
	  Alsa support in libao is buggy in versions 0.8.6 and earlier so
	  that the actual buffer time must be given in microseconds. At
	  this time it is not fixed in any official libao releases.
	- uade123 option --buffer-time=x can be used to set audio buffer
	  length to x milliseconds.

2006-01-21  Heikki Orsila <heikki.orsila@iki.fi>
	- Imported the LGPL'ed Max Trax source to amigasrc/players/max_trax.
	  Then applied a patch from alankila. It is not yet an eagleplayer
	  but a work-in-progress. (alankila)
	- Added a command 'i' to the debugger that traces till next hw
	  interrupt.
	- 'c' command in debugger will now also print cycle count.

2006-01-20  Heikki Orsila <heikki.orsila@iki.fi>
	- Continued frontend modularization and code sharing effort. Created
	  struct uade_song in eagleplayer.h to store relevant properties
	  of songs that are played. Modified uade123 and XMMS plugin to use
	  it. The transition is not completed yet. Many fields are still
	  unused and those fields unnecessarily duplicated in frontends.
	  Notice that audacious plugin is broken because of this, but it's
	  also in a transition phase.
	- Fixed merging conflicts between latest frontend modularization
	  effort and mlds mod/fileinfo changes.
	- Fixed bugs in songinfo.c. Some file checking could have read over
	  over memory boundary causing a segfault (but nothing else).
	- Backported fileinfo for DIGI-Booster mods. (mld)
	- Fixed a bug in XMMS plugin that it stopped a subsong too early
	  if there was another subsong to play. The sound data that was
	  buffered in audio output plugin was discarded. Thanks to Cthulhu
	  (the old one) for the bug report.


2006-01-19  Michael Doering <mldoering@gmx.net>
	- Improved vblank detection in Protracker replay for mod.slow_motion
	  by Jogeir Liljedahl. (mld)
	- Started work on backporting modinfo from uade 1. Ideally all
	  frontends should be able to use it. (mld)
	- Experimental "update fileinfo window on songchange" feature...

2006-01-18  Heikki Orsila <heikki.orsila@iki.fi>
	- Added a simple and broken XMMS file info window. Module info
	  displays a hexdump of the first 1024 bytes of the module.
	- Fixed #include issues with FreeBSD in unixatomic.c.
	- Optimized sinc interpolator (alankila)
	- Changed fileinfo.c to allow many different types of infos for
	  modules. Hexdump is the current default since nothing else has
	  been implemented.

2006-01-17  Michael Doering <mldoering@gmx.net>
	- (hopefully) Fixed broken subsong detection for Digital Illusion
	  mods.
	- Fixed unallocating timer resources when changing subsong in
	  MED/Octamed replayer. As a consequence, changing subsongs works
	  again.
	- Removed sinc table from audio.c and put it into a separate file
	  named sinctable.c. (alankila)
	- audacious plugin: changed legacy uade_ip audio output from xmms
	  to audacious 0.2 produce_audio(); Seems to work here, but I'm not
	  sure if it's 100% ok... So give it a test and report back.
	- Fixed strlrep.h to #include <strings.h> to have size_t type (shd)

2006-01-15  Heikki Orsila <heikki.orsila@iki.fi>
	- Added more debug messages into the interface between emulator and
	  sound core. Now Amiga file loading events will give informative
	  message to the frontend. Use uade123 with -v to see all the spam.

2006-01-14  Heikki Orsila <heikki.orsila@iki.fi>
	- Merged sinc interpolator patch (alankila)
	- Changed RK to CM prefix in amifilemagic. This affects custom made
	  format. Old RK and RKB prefixes are still supported but they may
	  be removed in the future.
	- Added contrib/sinc-integral.py which computes the sinc antialiasing
	  window for audio.c synthesis. (alankila)
	- Made huge changes into sound cores subsong restart and interrupt
	  logic. Some formats were fixed with respect to subsong changing.
	  Try Monkey Island now. The tempo should be correct after subsong
	  change. 4ch MED/OctaMED is still broken. Try changing to subsong
	  9 in DaveNinja.med (some channels do not get re-initialized and
	  a disturbing sound plays on the background). The changes are:
	    1. Earlier we didn't call StopInt and EndSound in subsong change,
	       but now we do. The old procedure just called InitSound and
	       StartInt because our allocators in sound core were robust
	       against double allocation.
	    2. Implemented unallocation for CIA resources. See
	       rem_cia[ab]_interrupt functions.
	    3. StopInt unallocates the CIA resource used for the player
	       interrupt. Set_player_interrupt allocates the player interrupt
	       and calls StartInt.
	    4. EndSound has a default code now which turns off audio DMA and
	       sets volumes to zero.
	    5. exec.library/SetIntVector() does not enable interrupts anymore.
	       If interrupts are disabled they stay disabled.

2006-01-12  Heikki Orsila <heikki.orsila@iki.fi>
	- Made anti (accumulator) interpolator to be the default.

2006-01-08  Michael Doering <mldoering@gmx.net>
	- Commited audacious input plugin based on the XMMS plugin
	  (http://audacious.nenoload.net).

2006-01-08  Heikki Orsila <heikki.orsila@iki.fi>
	- Fixed XMMS plugin installation which didn't obey package prefix
	  (Michal Januszewski <spock@gentoo.org>).
	- Added some more b-flags for fopen(). This time in code in
	  src/frontends/common.
	- Cleaned up sound data buffering code in uadeipc.c, uade.c and
	  audio.c. Removed uademsg.h as being useless.
	- Changed uadecontrol.c to uadeipc.c in src/Makefile.in because
	  uadecontrol.c is long gone.
	- Optimized uade123 to issue next song data request for the uadecore
	  before passing sample data to libao. This way the uadecore may
	  do useful work while libao is blocked on sound device. This didn't
	  solve the underrun problem completely but effect of improving
	  behavior is clearly observable with 'top'. Before this change, top
	  showed only 0.4% CPU usage for uadecore, but after the change it
	  shows 3.3% CPU usage, and the latter reflects reality much better.

2006-01-07  Heikki Orsila <heikki.orsila@iki.fi>
	- Changed fopen() to use "b" flag for porting to Windows environment.
	- Thanks to sasq <jonas@nightmode.org> for help with cross-compiling.

2006-01-06  Heikki Orsila <heikki.orsila@iki.fi>
	- Made uadeipc() re-entrant so that uadecore and a frontend could in
	  theory be run in the same process but different threads.
	- Replaced poll() with select() in unixatomic.c to be compatible with
	  weak systems.

2006-01-05  Heikki Orsila <heikki.orsila@iki.fi>
	- Continued cleaning up run-time configuration issues. uade123 and
	  XMMS plugin do not duplicate settings anymore. Most configuration
	  and command line options are stored inside 'struct uade_config'
	  which is defined in src/frontends/common/uadeconf.h.

2006-01-04  Heikki Orsila <heikki.orsila@iki.fi>
	- Changed -I./include/ to be -I./include in src/Makefile.in to make
	  it compatible with mingw.
	- PTK-Prowiz now accepts mods with max 1KiB trailing garbage...
	  Nevertheless use 100% good rips, people! (mld)
	- Fixed spelling mistake in PTK-Prowiz *g* (mld)
	- Updated uade123 man page with apologies about bad file detection
	  heuristic :(

2006-01-04  Heikki Orsila <heikki.orsila@iki.fi>
	* UADE 2.01
	- Compatibility fixes for OpenLSD and Mac OS X to make UADE compile
	- Added 'cm.' prefix for CustomMade format (Ron Klaren)
	- PTK-Prowiz subsong scanning was improved (mld)

2006-01-03  Heikki Orsila <heikki.orsila@iki.fi>
	- Cleaned up post-processing of sound data. Removed postprocessing.[ch]
	  because it was redundant functionality and added necessary
	  functionality into effects.[ch]. Also, moved effect state out of
	  effects.c by creating 'struct uade_effect'. This allows easy
	  loading and storing of state.
	  The goal is to have a unified mechanism for handling information
	  from command line options, uade.conf, eagleplayer.conf and
	  song.conf that is easy. All the setting must be storable and
	  restorable through that mechanism. Currently that is broken,
	  incomplete and messy. The functionality is even duplicated between
	  frontends :( It will probably take many cleanup steps to achieve
	  the goal.
	- Fixed Mac OS X compatibility issue. poll() was replaced with
	  select(). Thanks to Juuso Raitala.
	- Improved (hopefully) subsong detection for mods and similar. Now
	  there should be less false positives in PTK-Prowiz than there
	  used to be. (mld)
	- Removed 255 BPM SetTempo fix in PTK-Prowiz for mod.loader from
	  Coolspot to fix mod.alkupala by jorma... *sigh* (mld)
	- Fixed broken Prorunner support introduced by reorganization
	  PTK-Prowiz (mld)

2006-01-02  Heikki Orsila <heikki.orsila@iki.fi>
	- Fixed a configure bug that occured when --with-xmms was specified.
	  (Michal Januszewski <spock@gentoo.org>)
	- Made contrib/uadexmmsadd script to be installed if XMMS plugin is
	  installed
	- Added a work-around for OpenBSD 3.8 which lacks portable types from
	  stdint.h. inttypes.h is used instead. Possibly this avoids type
	  problems on some other OSes too. Note that we require some C99
	  features from standard C libraries. Thanks to ave@silokki.org.
	- Made OpenBSD use 'gmake'. Thanks to ave@silokki.org.
	- Fixed execlp() call in src/frontends/common/uadecontrol.c by
	  casting NULL as (char *). Thanks to ave@silokki.org.

2006-01-01  Heikki Orsila <heikki.orsila@iki.fi>
	* UADE 2.00 (Mental hangover)
	- Finally the first stable release of UADE 2 series. The work began
	  6 months ago. There are still rough edges and deficiencies but
	  it is superior to UADE 1 in many respects.
	- UADE 2 series has following improvements over UADE 1 series:
	    * Superior audio quality due to excellent Amiga 500 and 1200
	      filter models. The default sound model is now the Amiga 500
	      model. This affects all songs whether or not they use filtering.
	      (Antti S. Lankila)
	    * A component architecture which makes creating new frontends
	      easier
	    * Unified configuration files to set defaults for all frontends
	    * Improved command line tool, uade123, supports run-time control
	      of song playback for switching subsong, skipping to next song,
	      skipping  fast  forward,  pausing and altering post-processing
	      effects
	    * Post-processing effect for headphone users (Antti S. Lankila)
	    * Skip fast forward feature in uade123 and XMMS plugin
	    * Many core subsystems have been rewritten or heavily altered
	    * New supported formats
	    * UADE 1 produces snaps in audio output because of a bug in
	      audio DMA engine, but is fixed in UADE 2

2006-01-01  Heikki Orsila <heikki.orsila@iki.fi>
	- Added contrib/uadexmmsadd script to add uade:// prefixed songs into
	  XMMS playlist. This is useful to avoid conflicts with protracker
	  songs with modplug and other XMMS plugins. Any other plugin will not
	  accept uade:// prefixed entries from the playlist.
	- Changed forward seeking button in XMMS plugin from ">>" to "10s fwd".
	- Allow gain values greater than 1.0.
	- Improved uade123 man page.
	- Fixed a NULL pointer derefecence in eagleplayer.conf loading. If
	  eagleplayer.conf couldn't be loaded it would crash.
	- Fixed a directory creation problem with 'make feinstall'.

2005-12-30  Heikki Orsila <heikki.orsila@iki.fi>
	- Merged an altered sample accumulation patch from alankila. The
	  patch has an effect only if anti interpolator is used.
	- Removed crux, linear and rh interpolators because they're broken
	  by design. Only default and anti are now supported.

2005-12-22  Heikki Orsila <heikki.orsila@iki.fi>
	- Fixed shared library compilation for Mac OS X. Thanks to
	  Michael Baltaks <mbaltaks@mac.com> for information.

2005-12-21  Michael Doering <mldoering@gmx.net>
	- PTK-Prowiz: Commited various changes to cvs.
	    o Almost finished reorganizing and redoing the mod checks.
	    o Fixed bug in Soundtracker with repeat in bytes handling.
	    o Fixed some bugs in handling empty instruments.
	    o Added hack for vblank mod detection.
	    o Hopefully working, support for Karplusstrong fx.
	- Amifilemagic: backported a small bugfix in mod detection.

2005-12-20  Heikki Orsila <heikki.orsila@iki.fi>
	- Added a short note for Max OS X users to address a compilation
	  problem.
	- Renamed INSTALL to be INSTALL.readme to avoid makefile problems with
	  Mac OS X.

2005-12-19  Heikki Orsila <heikki.orsila@iki.fi>
	- Merged accurate audio output patch from Antti S. Lankila. The patch
	  solves the problem that Paula's 3.5 MHz output was sampled at
	  regular integer valued intervals that caused inaccuracy. The old
	  interval was round_down(3541200 / 44100) = 80 paula cycles, but
	  the real interval is ~80.299 paula cycles. This means 0.4% relative
	  error in outputted sampling rate that is not audible, but it is
	  harming filter accuracy analysis.

2005-12-17  Heikki Orsila <heikki.orsila@iki.fi>
	* UADE 1.50-pre10
	- Cleaned up src/include/events.h. Removed unnecessary event
	  scheduler.
	- Reworked audio subsystem to be more debuggable and added comments.
	- Fixed a bug in audio state engine that caused DMA engine to play
	  one word too much of sample data. How could this bug have gone
	  unnoticed for so long? The same bug exists in UAE too.
	- Reverted back to not using interpolation with A500E and A1200E
	  filters. The anti interpolator caused problems with many songs.
	  It will be fixed at some point and changed back, but at the
	  moment there's doubt how to fix the problem.

2005-12-16  Heikki Orsila <heikki.orsila@iki.fi>
	- Applied filter improvement and optimization to audio.c. The
	  filter should be slightly better than the old. Affects only
	  A500E and A1200E filters. (alankila)
	- Cleaned up audio.c
	- Reworked configuration loading system to avoid conflicts with
	  uade123 command line parameters. Command line parameters have
	  priority over uade.conf.

2005-12-15  Michael Doering <mldoering@gmx.net>
	- Some progress on porting the mod detection to m68k asm.

2005-12-15  Heikki Orsila <heikki.orsila@iki.fi>
	- Fixed a bug that forced filter to be A500E type when --force-led
	  was uade with uade123. (alankila)

2005-12-14  Heikki Orsila <heikki.orsila@iki.fi>
	- Added displaying total playtime based on content database into
	  uade123

2005-12-12  Michael Doering <mldoering@gmx.net>
	- replaced Grouleff replayer with Wanted Team's EarAche.
	- added new EMS replayer by Wanted Team.

2005-12-12  Heikki Orsila <heikki.orsila@iki.fi>
	- Added INSTALL file to document build process.

2005-12-11  Heikki Orsila <heikki.orsila@iki.fi>
	* UADE 1.50-pre9
	- An XMMS plugin has been added. New features compared to UADE1 XMMS
	  plugin are seek fast forward and correct subsong seeking bar. The
	  plugin still lacks GUI for configuration, but uade.conf can be
	  edited directly.
	- Filtering settings are audibly different compared to last release.
	  A500E filter model is now the default. It was A1200 in the last
	  release. This affects all songs, even those which do not use the
	  filter.
	- New players for 15 instrument soundtracker variants have been added.
	- uade123 man page has been updated.
	- Most subsystems have gone through changes. Some important changes
	  have been left out. See log entries for further details.

2005-12-11  Heikki Orsila <heikki.orsila@iki.fi>
	- Significant changes in filter default values. Current default filter
	  is A500E, which is audibly different on every song compared to the
	  old default (A1200). To restore the old behavior, set "filter a1200"
	  in uade.conf. If you want to advocate another default value, please
	  post to the forum or send email. The forum is preferred.

2005-12-10  Heikki Orsila <heikki.orsila@iki.fi>
	- Added notices to documentation that setting filter model has an
	  audible effect even if a song doesn't use filtering at all.
	- Cleaned up configure script (that is originated from uade1)

2005-12-07  Heikki Orsila <heikki.orsila@iki.fi>
	- Added unrecognizable type "packed" into amifilemagic. It is
	  used to inform user about files that are packed with an amiga
	  packer.
	- some work on m68k mod checking and replay routine (mld)

2005-12-06  Michael Doering <mldoering@gmx.net>
	- XMMS plugin now automagically advances the subsong seek slider, if
	  the replay rolls over to the next subsong.
	- Soundtracker15 name check that was added yesterday was removed. (shd)
	- Fixed a bug in uade_filemagic() that char *pre was not initialized
	  to be an empty string by default. This caused
	  uade_analyze_file_format() to receive garbage data when file format
	  was not recognized. (shd)
	- Valgrinded a memory allocation bug in two places of eagleplayer.c
	  (the same error actually due to replicating same lines of code),
	  where space for (n + 1) pointers should have been allocated, but
	  only ((n * sizeof ptr) + 1) bytes was allocated. (shd)
	- Added gain effect into uade.conf. You can use variable named
	  'gain' to set scaling value for each outputted sample. For
	   example, add a following line to uade.conf:
	   gain 0.25 (shd)
	- Made length test of mods with 32 instruments less strict. Due to
	  popular demand *g* now "oversize mods" get accepted.
	- Added check for sane finetune and volume values in modchecks.

2005-12-05  Heikki Orsila <heikki.orsila@iki.fi>
	- Added initial version of song length database into XMMS plugin. It
	  is compatible with uade1 db-content, but named differently:
	  ~/.uade2/contentdb. You can just copy the old db:
	    cp ~/.uade/db-content ~/.uade2/contentdb
	- Content db is loaded during play_file if it has changed
	  on the disk. If it has not changed on the disk, then it is
	  saved if an hour has passed and the db has been changed.
	- Added a requirement for Soundtracker15 song content detection that
	  the name must have prefix or postix being: "mod", "mod15", or
	  "mod15_". This change could be reverted at some point but now it's
	  the safest choice.

2005-12-04  Heikki Orsila <heikki.orsila@iki.fi>
	- Added missing #include for uadecontrol.h (sys/types.h for pid_t).

2005-12-03  Heikki Orsila <heikki.orsila@iki.fi>
	- Made XMMS plugin display play time correctly in the play list
	  after a song ends. If song ended volutarily, tell XMMS the
	  play time. If song ended involuntarily by user intervention,
	  error, or timeout, tell XMMS that the song doesn't have a length
	  leaving the play list time empty.

2005-12-02  Heikki Orsila <heikki.orsila@iki.fi>
	- Fixed a latency and time bug in the XMMS plugin that affected
	  fast forward seeking. When forward seeking happened the XMMS time
	  display was not updated and the seeking happened with a delay.
	- Made XMMS plugin report the play time for XMMS after a song
	  ends.
	- Added comments about variable locking in XMMS plugin.

2005-12-01  Michael Doering <mldoering@gmx.net>
	- eagleplayer.conf: Amended the different MarkCooksey prefixes.
	- amifilemagic: fixed TFMX 1.5 detection bug  introduced by the recent
	  clean-up.
	- amifilemagic: fixed another TFMX detection bug. Should be alright
	  again now.

2005-11-30  Heikki Orsila <heikki.orsila@iki.fi>
	- Make XMMS plugin auto detectable in configure script. The plugin is
	  still very experimental and incomplete in features, but it can
	  already play songs, or at least it should.
	- GCC4 gave warnings of problems I had not noticed: Fixed a bug in
	  md5.h. uint32_t was accidently redefined (that is #included
	  originally from stdint.h). XMMS plugin's uade_ip structure was
	  declared static but later as external. Fixed signedness warnings
	  from various modules.
	- Added seek-forward button into XMMS plugin. (mld)
	- New replayer for Soundtracker v2-v5 mods with 15 instruments and
	  a lot of different effects added. (mld)
	- fixed WaitAudioDMA for all old mod15 replayers. (thanks heikki!)
	- changed mod15 (again) for stricter st-iv detection (mld)
	- changed to a stricter tracker module length policy...
	  If uade doesn't play your modfiles anymore, it's a bad rip.
	  Get a good one! :)
	- Since Master-Soundtracker files seem to use a subset of the normal
	  Soundtracker fx, they now get played with the mod15 replay
	  This makes Master-ST replayer kind of obsolete atm. (mld)

2005-11-29  Heikki Orsila <heikki.orsila@iki.fi>
	- Partial and buggy implementation of song.conf. It is used for uade
	  specific work-arounds for broken or bad songs. Look at doc/song.conf
	  and src/frontends/common/eagleplayer.c. Please do not use this yet.
	- Fixed some compiler warnings that surprisingly came with gcc 4.0.2.
	- Fixed Makefile.in to not report error on 'make install' when XMMS
	  plugin is not installed.

2005-11-28  Heikki Orsila <heikki.orsila@iki.fi>
	- Modularized loading and parsing on uade.conf options. See
	  src/frontends/common/uadeconf.[ch].
	- It is possible that config parsing for uade123 breaks now.
	- Added partial config loading support for XMMS plugin. Doesn't
	  support setting filter type or interpolation mode yet. You must
	  edit uade.conf by hand if you want configuration changes. No GUI
	  for setting options yet.
	- Added cleaning rule for XMMS plugin
	- New make rule: 'make feclean' will clean all frontend objects
	- The XMMS plugin determines configuration file path for uade.conf
	  once during XMMS plugin initialization, and it will not change
	  afterwards. If no global or user configuration is found, then
	  the plugin chooses the file under HOME ($HOME/.uade2/uade.conf).
	  It will try to load the configuration each time a new song is
	  selected from the XMMS.
	- Optimization: XMMS will re-read configuration when a new song is
	  selected if the file timestamp of uade.conf has changed.
	- Fixed synchronization problem in XMMS plugin's play loop. The audio
	  device is drained of written sound data before actually stopping
	  the device. The earlier version cut of audible data from the end
	  of the song :( However, draining can be interrupted if the user
	  requests something urgent, such as wanting an immediate song change.
	  Draining takes time as long as audio
	  device has buffered data. Buffering settings can be found from
	  output plugin settings, as usual.

2005-11-28  Heikki Orsila <heikki.orsila@iki.fi>
	- Added hardcoded timeouts for the XMMS plugin. They are the same
	  as uade123 defaults. 20 seconds for silence and 512 seconds for
	  subsong. Reading uade.conf variables is not supported yet.

2005-11-27  Heikki Orsila <heikki.orsila@iki.fi>
	- Continuing modularization of uade frontends. Various commands,
	  such as set subsong, change subsong, set filter type, and set
	  interpolation mode, were moved to src/frontends/common/uadecontrol.c.
	  The idea is that all the non-trivial commands have a wrapper in
	  uadecontrol.c, but trivial commands that don't require parameters
	  can be used through uadeipc.c (uade_send_short_message()).
	- Added src/include/uadeconstants.h that should contain constants that
	  are common with uadecore and frontends.
	- Subsong seeking works in XMMS plugin :-)
	- Made XMMS plugin globally installable as it should be

2005-11-26  Heikki Orsila <heikki.orsila@iki.fi>
	- Continuing modularization of uade frontends. Renamed
	  src/uadecontrol.c to be src/uadeipc.c, and added
	  src/frontends/common/uadecontrol.c which contains a set of
	  helper functions to control and spawn uadecore.
	- Added --with-xmms to configure script for developing the XMMS
	  plugin. It does not work yet!

2005-11-25  Heikki Orsila <heikki.orsila@iki.fi>
	- Cleaned up and fixed tronictest check in amifilemagic. Added
	  read_be_u16() and read_be_u32() to help parsing amiga formats.
	- Cleaned up tfmxtest in amifilemagic.
	- Cleaned up modparsing in amifilemagic.

2005-11-24  Michael Doering <mldoering@gmx.net>
	- amifilemagic: improved mod32 and mod15 checks a bit
	- ha! found pitchbend incompatibility bewteen
	  Master-ST and DOC Soundtracker II in amifilemagic. Now
	  Mods using the pitchbends bigger than 0xf are played as
	  DOC Soundtracker II:)

2005-11-23  Michael Doering <mldoering@gmx.net>
	- Master-ST and Ultimate-ST replayers now check for a valid file
	  length, thus badly ripped mod15 songs won't get played anymore with
	  UADE. No exceptions.
	  FYI this will also be future for all other Sound and Protracker
	  derivates, so for anyone having bad rips - get some valid files! :)

2005-11-22  Michael Doering <mldoering@gmx.net>
	- Improved amifilemagic: mod32 check now tries to distinguish
	  10 different mod types. (BTW. 4ch Fastracker mods and similar
	  now default to mod_pc and get played by the Multichannel PS3M player)
	- Some more work on the mod15 check in amifilemagic again.
	- Started to update the amiga mod15 replayers (Ultimate-ST and
	  Master-ST with better checks, resulting in breaking support for other
	  players like EP or DT atm.

2005-11-18  Michael Doering <mldoering@gmx.net>
	- Lowered the file buffer size to 8192 bytes to reduce overhead with
	  xmms plugin scans. Unfortunately mods with a header and pattern data
	  beyond that buffer size can't be detected properly and get played
	  as plain mod15.
	- Improved mod15 check. It should produce now less false positives.
	- Added a smarter(?) way of the mod  check for larger files that
	  don't fit into the check buffer completely.
	- Renamed filemagic() to uade_filemagic() (shd)
	- Filemagic buffer size (8192) is now passed as an argument to
	  uade_filemagic(). Previously both the caller and callee knew the
	  size.
	- Made amifilemagic tables static (only visible inside the module)
	  (shd)
	- Name prefix conflict between Future Player and PTK-Prowiz was
	  resolved in favor of Future Player. The name prefix/extension is
	  'fp'. (shd)

2005-11-16  Heikki Orsila <heikki.orsila@iki.fi>
	- Made install to a standard path by default. That is /usr/local.
	  Use ./configure --prefix to override. configure --user will install
	  to users home directory as in the past.
	- Committed initial version of man page for uade123.
	- added a first uade-only mod15_Mastertracker player (mld)
	- improved (?) mod15 type checks in amifilemagic (mld)
	- started to work on more complete mod type check in amifilemagic
	  (mld)

2005-11-13  Heikki Orsila <heikki.orsila@iki.fi>
	- Cleaned up src/frontends/common/eagleplayer.c. Removed skip_ws(),
	  skip_nws(), and loops that used them, and replaced those with
	  shorted loops that use strsep(). Changed index variables to use
	  size_t instead of int to be more robust against bad input.
	- Fixed a bug that if eagleplayers.conf specifies always_ends for
	  an eagleplayer then forcing timeout from command line with -t
	  didn't work.
	- Fixed a dirty bug in score that made score crash if an eagleplayer
	  gave a NULL pointer as module name. This happened with Frontier
	  custom. Closer inspection revealed that Frontier custom is also
	  buggy because it sets module name in InitSound() but the
	  specification says module name is evaluated after InitPlayer()
	  which is before InitSound(). This looks like a design bug in
	  the interface, or a typo in the documentation, because setting
	  module separately for each subsong is useful, and that is what
	  Frontier actually does.

2005-11-12  Heikki Orsila <heikki.orsila@iki.fi>
	- Add new antialiasing interpolation mode, which corrects for noisy
	  treble especially audible in the A1200 filter model. It does its
	  work by computing the average value of Paula's output pins between
	  samples.

2005-11-09  Michael Doering <mldoering@gmx.net>
	- Fixed missing hipc and soc prefixes in eagleplayer.conf.
	- Associated #chn, ##ch mods to PS3M again. (note: s3m, xm or mtm
	  are still omitted by uade)

2005-11-08  Heikki Orsila <heikki.orsila@iki.fi>
	- Added slight noise reduction into CSpline code to reduce
	  noise due to interpolation errors, and snapping sounds from
	  sudden volume changes. (alankila)
	- Updated headphone filtering parameters to place virtual
	  sound sources closer to head and reduced the associated treble
	  filtering to make the sound at the same time brighter and more
	  forward placed. The sources still appear slightly behind and
	  perhaps elevated, so the illusion will be further improved.
	  (alankila)
	- fixed AON8 timing now for real *grin* (mld)
	- added Musicline Editor to be detected by amifilemagic (mld)

2005-11-07  Michael Doering <mldoering@gmx.net>
	- Removed dupes from new eagleplayer.conf (mld)
	- Added new player: Musicline Editor (mld)
	- Broke ArtOfNoise8 timing, and added song end detection. (mld)

2005-11-06  Heikki Orsila <heikki.orsila@iki.fi>
	- Added an experimental support for eagleplayer.conf, which is
	  specified at doc/eagleplayer.conf. The new system allows eagleplayer
	  specific settings. uadeformats is no longer used, so it has been
	  removed. Here's a list of currently possible eagleplayer options:
	    a500 (A500 type filter emulation is used.)
	    a1200 (A1200 type filter emulation is used.)
	    always_ends (A song always ends, so timeouts are not used.)
	    content_detection (File name prefix or postfix heuristics are not
	                      used for determining format.)
	    speed_hack (Speed hack is enabled.)
	  Tips:
	  Speed hack can be turned on for a specific format by editing
	  eagleplayer.conf. A format can be marked as ending always, which
	  means that timeout values are not used (except silence timeout).
	  There are other options too, and all of them are specified in
	  doc/eagleplayer.conf.


2005-11-05  Heikki Orsila <heikki.orsila@iki.fi>
	- Player interrupt is now a CIA A interrupt by default. As a
	  consequence CUST.Loom works (it requires that player interrupt
	  runs at a lower priority level than audio interrupts).
	  THM.BlueAngel69 might play better now - a good comparison is needed.
	  There are still a few things to do in the sound core's interrupt
	  system, see amigasrc/score/todo.txt.
	- Headphones effect clipping fix (alankila)
	- Added improved (but currently experimental) LED filtering code.
	  The old code was based on assumption that A500 and A1200 have same
	  output filtering circuitry, but this was not correct. After
	  analysing hi-fi measurements by pyksy, I designed new filters
	  by tweaking a couple of equalizers on top of a RC filter that
	  provided basic treble attenuation. Use --filter=a500e or a1200e to
	  test the new filters. (alankila)

2005-11-04  Heikki Orsila <heikki.orsila@iki.fi>
	- Separated CIA B timer A and timer B interrupts finally. Some
	  Forgotten World songs started to work, but not all. Thomas
	  Herman BlueAngel69 swent back to its earlier buggy state. Our
	  recent interrupt handler change broke Thomas Hermann completely.
	  This change fixes our original design fault that only one CIA
	  timer interrupt may be used, but not both. This patch takes us
	  much closer to full CIA interrupt handler support.
	- Heikki's CIAB-A and CIAB-B separation in soundcore gave us full
	  support of the MusiclineEditor player from Eagleplayer 2.02.
	  You still have to use --speedhack to give it enough
	  cpu cycles, though. (mld)
	- forgot to add detection bug fix of the two different MCMD formats
	  in amifilemagic to changelog *grin* (mld)

2005-11-03  Heikki Orsila <heikki.orsila@iki.fi>
	* UADE 1.50-pre8
	- Many bug fixes and cleanups.
	- Headphones postprocessing effect.
	- Improved A1200 filter emulation.
	- Added A500 filter emulation. Use --filter=a500.
	- Cleaned up sound cores timer code.
	- Fixed CIA timer initialization.
	- Improved uade123 user interface. Press 'h' in uade123 or list
	  action keys with uade123 --help.
	- New sample interpolation code (--interpolator=cspline).
	- --stderr can be used to pipe sound data to stdout.

2005-11-02  Heikki Orsila <heikki.orsila@iki.fi>
	- Fixed a very stupid bug I introduced yesterday to src/uade.c.
	  if (curs > maxs)
	    foo();
	    bar();
	  Duh. Why did I forgot {}??
	- Network byte orderized, or big endianized, subsong info transmission
	  between uadecore and frontend. This wasn't a bug. Just a change for
	  consistency.

2005-11-01  Heikki Orsila <heikki.orsila@iki.fi>
	- Removed src/effects.c. It was accidently left there from uade 1
	  (alankila)
	- Removed unnecessary functionality from src/players.c. Black listing
	  Protracker modules to be VBI timed should be in frontend logic
	  rather than emulator logic.
	- Cleaned up text messages all over the place.

2005-10-31  Heikki Orsila <heikki.orsila@iki.fi>
	- Did highly experimental changes to sound core's timing interrupt
	  system. I tested the change with all known players, and only the
	  Thomas Hermann broke out, but it was broken already, so no big
	  loss there. Of course I only tested each format with a few songs,
	  so it's very possible that if the new system doesn't work,
	  then I couldn't catch the problems. Nevertheless, I spent over an
	  hour listening to different samples. Testing this change would be
	  appreciated. One should especially pay attention to tempo, because
	  that may have gone wrong. The changes I technically made were:
	  - Made default interrupt timer to be CIA B timer A. Took away all
	    the hacks to use VBI when ever possible to be the default timer.
	  - While turning on any CIA B timer (A or B), it does not turn off
	    the other CIA B timer.
	  - Fixed CIA B timer initialization. Setting a timer (A or B) gets
	    the timer value from dtg_Timer(eaglebase).
	  - Cleaned up audio interrupt server.
	- Fixed tiny bug in uade123 file extension detection (mld)
	- Moved amifilemagic, uadeformats, and unixwalkdir modules to
	  frontends/common/ where they belong.

2005-10-30  Heikki Orsila <heikki.orsila@iki.fi>
	- Modified headphones effect. (alankila)
	- Added 'H' action key to toggle headphones effect, and 'P' to toggle
	  panning effect. Default panning value is 0.7, unless specified
	  otherwise with command line option or in uade.conf.
	- Added forgotten -O2 optimization flag to uade123 Makefile
	- Cleaned audio.c. Removed some debug #defines.
	- Imported amiga player sources from uade1 project to amigasrc/players/

2005-10-29  Heikki Orsila <heikki.orsila@iki.fi>
	- Antti S. Lankila <alankila@bel.fi> will be referred to as 'alankila'
	  in ChangeLog from now.
	- Beautified and cleaned up audio.c and sd-sound-generic.h.
	- Fixed a bug that caused 1 bit precision loss in audio output.
	  Sample data was multiplied after filtering, but it should have been
	  multiplied before. (alankila)
	- cust.Bubble_Bobble gives wrong subsong information. Added a logic
	  into uade123 that determines subsong ranges if default subsong
	  is outside the reported range.
	- Changed score's CIA setup so that both CIA-A and CIA-B time of day
	  counters run continously. Some players, such as Oktalyzer and
	  sean connolly depend on this. As a consequence it was possible to
	  remove a work around from score that patched the sean connolly
	  player not to use CIA TOD. However, any player using CIA TOD is at
	  risk of not functioning properly, but I have only seen two cases
	  so far (those which I mentioned).
	- Removed score from uade source root, now it's only located at
	  amigasrc/score/ directory.
	- Fixed a bug in uade123/playloop.c. If one subsong ended because of
	  silence, all the rest subsongs would end because of silence too.
	  I forgot to reset the silence counter to zero..
	- Added a headphone postprocessing effect, and an effect framework for
	  different uade frontends. Try --headphone. (alankila)
	- Try pressing 'p' on uade123 to toggle postprocessing effects on
	  and off.
	- New filter code (alankila)

2005-10-28  Heikki Orsila <heikki.orsila@iki.fi>
	- Radical cleaned up in audio.c.
	- Fixed rh and crux interpolators. Thanks to Antti S. Lankila.
	  <alankila@bel.fi>
	- Removed lots of unnecessary macros, variables and functions.
	- rh interpolator is now names as linear.
	- Removed src/config.h. It is unnecessary.
	- uade123 help will now print usable action keys too. Also, one may
	  press 'h' at run-time to see usable keys. It will print currently
	  as follows:
	  Action keys for interactive mode:
	   '.'           Skip 10 seconds forward.
	   SPACE, 'b'    Go to next subsong.
	   'c'           Pause.
	   'f'           Toggle filter (takes filter control away from eagleplayer).
	   'h'           Print this list.
	   RETURN, 'n'   Next song.
	   'q'           Quit.
	   's'           Toggle between shuffle mode and normal play.
	   'x'           Restart current subsong.
	   'z'           Previous subsong.
	- To verify whether a song uses filter or not, enable verbose mode
	  for uade123 by -v. You'll see messages like:
	   Message: Filter ON
	- Added two different types of filters: A500 and A1200. Thanks to
	  Antti S. Lankila, again. Use --filter=a500 or --filter=a1200,
	  the A1200 case is the default. Both types of filter are
	  but A1200 filter is better tested. We need feedback on A500 filter.
	- --force-filter was changed to --force-led.
	- Fixed a bug with getopts. The long options list was not zero
	  terminated, and it had worked by luck so long..
	- Added good ol' speed hack feature into uade123. Use --speedhack
	  to increase CPU speed for players that extra virtual power. It
	  is useful for players that require more cpu than 68k can give,
	  multichannel oktalyzer for example.

2005-10-27  Heikki Orsila <heikki.orsila@iki.fi>
	- Made interpolation mode selectable from command line. Use
	  --interpolator=x to choose the interpolation mode, where
	    x       = default (no interpolation),
	    rh      = rh interpolator (broken atm),
	    crux    = crux interpolator (broken atm),
	    cspline = Antti S. Lankila's spline interpolator
	              (This is not recommended for chip songs! The spline
		       spline interpolator is good for natural instruments,
		       but may produce bad sounds with chips.)
	- Interpolator is selectable from uade.conf file by adding line:
	    interpolator foo
	  Note that using anything else but default is not recommended
	  at the moment.
	- As per Michael Doering's needs, I added --stderr option to uade123.
	  It will force all terminal output printed onto the stderr, and thus
	  allows piping pure sound data. Example:
	    uade123 --stderr -e raw -f /dev/stdout DW.Platoon |postprocessing

2005-10-27  Heikki Orsila <heikki.orsila@iki.fi>
	* UADE 1.50-pre7
	- Antti S. Lankila <alankila@bel.fi> fixed and improved filter
	  behavior. The filter state must be updated even when filtering
	  is not outputted. Output scaling was fixed to the right place
	  so that it does not distort filter state. Unnecessary range
	  scaling of input samples was removed. Some documentation was
	  added about technical properties of the IIR filter.
	- Filtering by default was not enabled for those people who had an
	  earlier uade2 version installed to their home directory, because
	  make install does not overwrite ~/.uade2/uade.conf. Now the default
	  is hard coded into the source code.

2005-10-27  Heikki Orsila <heikki.orsila@iki.fi>
	* UADE 1.50-pre6 (tester pre)
	- Uade core now supports only 16-bits stereo. If 8-bits or mono is
	  needed the sample data can be postprocessed.
	- Added experimental filtering support. It should be better than the
	  one found from uade1. Thanks to Antti S. Lankila <alankila@bel.fi>
	  for IIR filter coefficients and advice.
	- New uade.conf options:
	   filter     - enable filter emulation
	   no_filter  - disable filter emulation
	   filter_off - turn filter always off
	- New command line options:
	   --filter Enable filter emulation
	   --force-filter=x, where x = 0, or x = 1. Set filter state either
	     off (0) or on (1).

2005-10-16  Heikki Orsila <heikki.orsila@iki.fi>
	- Added a fuzzy state diagram on client-server interaction from client
	  perspective.

2005-10-08  Heikki Orsila <heikki.orsila@iki.fi>
	- Unknown keywords in uade.conf are ignored. Old behavior was to
	  terminate uade123 on an unknown keyword.
	- First try to load uade.conf from ~/.uade2/uade.conf, and then
	  try the global config file ($PREFIX/etc/uade.conf)
	- Simplify playloop in uade123.
	- Beautify directory hierarchy scanning by avoiding unnecessary
	  '/' characters.
	- Started specifying uade client-server protocol. See
	  doc/play_loop_state_diagram.dia.
	- Removed S3M support. It's not an Amiga format, and thus it doesn't
	  belong to UADE. It might also interfere with other players when
	  UADE is used as an XMMS plugin. Use XMP, modplug or something
	  else for these formats.
	- 'make check' is now 'make soundcheck' because it's more a sound
	  check than a good test set.

2005-10-03  Heikki Orsila <heikki.orsila@iki.fi>
	- Action keys made into default behavior for uade123.

2005-09-08  Heikki Orsila <heikki.orsila@iki.fi>
	- Giulio Canevari pointed out that --panning doesn't work. For
	  some reason I didn't notice that (perhaps didn't test ;-). The
	  problem was false parameters for GNU getopt.
	- mod2ogg2.sh from Giulio Canevari

2005-09-04  Heikki Orsila <heikki.orsila@iki.fi>
	- Added -g option to uade123 to only print information about songs.
	  Songs are not played in this mode. All relevant output goes into
	  stdout. This should be useful for scripting people. An example:

	  $ uade123 -g /svu/chip/mod/mod.Unit-a-remix 2>/dev/null
	  playername: Protracker & relatives
	  modulename: unit-a-remix
	  formatname: type: Protracker
	  subsong_info: 1 1 1 (cur, min, max)
	  <uade123 quits fast>

2005-09-01  Heikki Orsila <heikki.orsila@iki.fi>
	- Cygwin fixes. Add cygwin detection to configure script. Makefile
	  should be aware that uade123 is named uade123.exe on cygwin.

2005-08-27  Heikki Orsila <heikki.orsila@iki.fi>
	- Fixed a memory copying bug which could cause sound data
	  corruption when skipping 10 seconds forward with uade123. The bug
	  was at playloop.c:273. memmove should be used instead of memcpy (shd)
	- A patch from Jarno Paananen <jpaana@s2.org>. It fixes use of C99
	  anonymous initializers with sigaction (2) on Cygwin.

2005-07-28  Heikki Orsila <heikki.orsila@iki.fi>
	* UADE 1.50-pre5 (developer release)
	- Nothing better to do. Let's release the new version for users to
	  test.

2005-07-25  Heikki Orsila <heikki.orsila@iki.fi>
	- It seems ALSA lib could fork and consequently terminate a process
	  when used through libao, and we must not consider it an error in
	  our signal handler that catches all dead children. The signal
	  handler assumed that the only child that could die is uade. (shd)

2005-07-24  Heikki Orsila <heikki.orsila@iki.fi>
	- New keys for interactive mode:
	   [0-9]  - Select subsong in range [0, 9]
	   q	  - Quit player
	   s      - Switch between normal and shuffle mode
	   x      - Restart current subsong
	- Added - or --no-song-end switches. Song just keeps playing even if
	  the amiga player says it has ended. Dude! You can get pretty weird
	  sounds with this, and sometimes the sound core crashes, and should
	  crash. Fortunately that doesn't kill the simulator :)
	- Made help print (-h) prettier by aligning tex columns
	- Added -K or --no-keys to disable action keys (this can be used to
	  override the uade.conf if it enables actions by default).

2005-07-23  Heikki Orsila <heikki.orsila@iki.fi>
        * UADE 1.50-pre4 (developer release)
	- Added shell interaction keys into UADE123. The keys can be enabled
	  with -k switch, or adding line "action_keys" into uade.conf.
	  The keys are (mimiking XMMS):
	    z     - Previous subsong
	    c     - Pause
	    b     - Next subsong
	    n     - Next song
	    .     - Skip 10 seconds forward
	    ENTER - Next song
	    SPACE - Next subsong
	  Does someone want these configurable into uade.conf? Please email
	  me.

2005-07-22  Heikki Orsila <heikki.orsila@iki.fi>
	* UADE 1.50-pre3 (developer release)
	- Added a -j to skip x seconds of audio from the beginning. Note that
	  this does not affect timeout parameters in any way. If timeout is
	  1 minute and skip is 2 minutes, the song will just end before
	  anything is played.

2005-07-21  Heikki Orsila <heikki.orsila@iki.fi>
	- Added silence timeout
	- Wrote a config file parser for uade123. Look at uade.conf file
	  for instructions. uade123 tries to load following files in order on
	  startup: BASEDIR/uade.conf and $(HOME)/.uade2/uade.conf. Command
	  line options can override config file parameters. Users of uade123
	  might want to configure timeout, panning and such values as
	  personal defaults. This is a very important feature important over
	  uade 1.0x command line tool.
	- Restructured uade123 code into different code modules to make
	  maintaining and code reuse easier.

2005-07-18  Heikki Orsila <heikki.orsila@iki.fi>
	- Fixed a bug in uade123 that prevented it from playing the last
	  subsong of a song.

2005-07-18  Heikki Orsila <heikki.orsila@iki.fi>
	* UADE 1.50-pre2 (developer release)
	- uade123 now has eagleplayer fileformat check ignoring feature (-i),
	  panning (-p), song timeout (-t), and subsong timeouts (-w)

2005-07-17  Heikki Orsila <heikki.orsila@iki.fi>
	- uade123 now uses GNU getopt
	- uade123 can now output both raw and wav formats by using libao
	  file output mechanism. Wav format is the default. Example:
	  uade123 -e wav -f foo.wav songfile
	- The sound core now reports to the simulator when audio output should
	  start. Traditionally the simulator has produced audio output from
	  the reboot of the amiga even if it is only useful to output audio
	  after all the lengthy player initializations have been made in
	  the sound core. For example, AHX.Cruisin now has 0.96 seconds less
	  zero samples in the beginning.
	- Cleaned up sound core a bit. Removed some unused definitions
	  of messages between sound core and the simulator. Removed unused
	  code that was designed to be used when running sound core under a
	  _real_ AmigaOS.
	- Made uade123 less verbose. Use -v option to get more details.
	- Renamed uade-trivial.c to 'uade123.c' in src/frontends/uade123
	- Renamed directory 'trivial' to 'uade123' in src/frontends/

2005-07-15  Heikki Orsila <heikki.orsila@iki.fi>
        * UADE 1.50-pre1 (developer release)
	- Lots of changes into uade123
	- This is just a preview of the new system. There are no interesting
	  features over uade 1.0x versions. This release doesn't even have
	  xmms / beepmp plugins.
	- Short instructions for testing:
	   $ ./configure && make
	   $ make test
	   $ make install
	  Will install everything to $(HOME)/.uade2/. Then
	  $(HOME)/.uade2/uade123 is the player you can use. This version
	  uses libao for audio output.

2005-07-12  Heikki Orsila <heikki.orsila@iki.fi>
	- Code in src/amifilemagic.c does amiga fileformats detection. If it's
	  useful for any other project out there, it is now dual licensed
	  under the GNU GPL _and_ Public Domain. By public domain we mean
	  that you can do anything you like with the code, including
	  relicensing arbitrarily for your projects.

2005-07-11  Heikki Orsila <heikki.orsila@iki.fi>
	- Improved the command line frontend in src/frontends/trivial/,
	  and now it is called uade123. It can now do fileformat detection by
	  content, and load proper players from their installation place.
	  Also, it can play multiple songs in a sequence if one switches to
	  next song with ctrl-c before the song actually ends. If the song
