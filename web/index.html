<h1 id='about'>About</h1>
<p>DeaDBeeF (as in 0xDEADBEEF) is an audio player for GNU/Linux systems with X11.</p>
<p>Current alpha version features:</p>
<ul>
    <li>written in C99 except sid module, because of libsidplay2, which only has a C++ API (though some 3rd party libraries are entirely in C++)</li>
    <li>mp3, ogg vorbis, flac</li>
    <li>reading id3 v1, v2.2, v2.3, v2.4, apev2, xing/info tags for mp3</li>
    <li>character set detection for non-unicode id3 tags - supports cp1251 and iso8859-1</li>
    <li>unicode tags are fully supported as well (both utf8 and ucs2)</li>
    <li>cuesheet support for mp3, ogg and flac</li>
    <li>sid and some popular chiptune formats like nsf</li>
    <li>tracker modules like mod, s3m, it, xm, etc</li>
    <li>HVSC song length database support for sid</li>
    <li>gtk2 interface with custom highly speed/memory optimized widgets</li>
    <li>no GNOME or KDE dependencies - just gtk2 and several small libraries</li>
    <li>minimize to tray, with scrollwheel volume control</li>
    <li>drag and drop, both inside of playlist, and from filemanagers and such</li>
    <li>control playback from command line (allows global hotkeys using xbindkeys)</li>
    <li>seeking works in all supported formats</li>
    <li>duration calculation is as precise as possible for vbr mp3 files (with and without xing/info tags)</li>
    <li>fully functional on x86 and x86_64 architectures. ppc and ppc64 support untested, but may work as well</li>
</ul>
