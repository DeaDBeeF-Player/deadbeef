  <!-- ============= General Information About Glade =========== -->

  <sect1 id="general">
   <title>General Information</title>

   <sect2><title>
     What documentation is there for Glade?
    </title>
    
     <para>
     In the GNOME version of Glade the Glade Manual and this FAQ should be
available from the Help menu.
     </para>
     <para>
There are a few other tutorials and guides available on the Internet,
in several languages. Links to these can be found on Glade's website at
<ulink url="http://glade.gnome.org" type="http">glade.gnome.org</ulink>.
     </para>
    
   </sect2> 

   <sect2><title>
     Is there any example code?
    </title>
    
     <para>
Glade includes a simple text editor example application in the examples/editor
directory. If you have a binary-only package of Glade, these files have
probably not been installed, so you'll need to download the Glade source
code from
<ulink url="http://glade.gnome.org" type="http">glade.gnome.org</ulink>.
     </para>
     <para>
The website also contains links to quite a few applications created using Glade.
These may contain useful example code. See the 'Applications' page on
<ulink url="http://glade.gnome.org" type="http">glade.gnome.org</ulink>.
     </para>
    
   </sect2> 

   <sect2><title>
     Do I have to use a particular license for the C code generated by Glade?
    </title>
    
     <para>
No. You are free to use whatever license you like for the C code generated
by Glade.
     </para>
     <para>
Though in the spirit of free software we do encourage you to use the GPL or
LGPL licenses.
     </para>
    
   </sect2> 

   <sect2><title>
     Which is better - generated C code or libglade?
    </title>
    
     <para>
For large projects libglade is recommended over generated C code.
You can keep each window or dialog in a separate XML file, which makes it
more manageable for large projects with multiple developers.
     </para>
     <para>
If you do want to use generated C code for large projects, I'd still suggest
keeping each window or dialog in a separate XML file. You can change the
project options so that the C code is output into separate files for each
window or dialog (e.g. change <filename>interface.c</filename> to
<filename>main_window.c</filename>), and turn
off all the 'File Output' options.
     </para>
    
   </sect2> 

   <sect2><title>
How do I port a GTK+ 1.2 or GNOME 1.4 project to GTK+/GNOME 2.0.
    </title>
    
     <para>
libglade includes a script called libglade-convert which will convert an
old GTK+ 1.2 or GNOME 1.4 Glade XML file to the new GTK+/GNOME 2.0 format.
     </para>
     <para>
However, for GTK+ applications there is currently a slight problem with this.
You need to:
  (1) Convert the XML file with libglade-convert.
  (2) Open the new file in Glade and save it immediately. This will create
      the project options file with the same name as the XML file but with
      a 'p' on the end.
  (3) Add '&lt;gnome_support&gt;FALSE&lt;/gnome_support&gt;'
      to the project options file, so Glade knows it is a GTK+ project.
     </para>
    
   </sect2> 

  </sect1>

  <!-- ============= Creating A User Interface In Glade ======== -->

  <sect1 id="creating">
   <title>Creating A User Interface</title>

   <sect2><title>
      When I add a widget to a window, it fills the whole window and I
      can't add any other widgets.
    </title>
    
     <para>
      This is not a bug in <application>Glade</application>! In GTK+
      you use containers to lay out your widgets. The commonly-used
      containers are at the bottom of the main page on the
      palette. Try adding a vertical box to a window in
      <application>Glade</application>. Now add a table to one of the
      positions in the vertical box.  Do you get the idea now?
     </para>
     <para>
      If you really want to position widgets at specific coordinates,
      try the Fixed container. However, this isn't recommended since
      your  windows/dialogs will not look good when resized, and if
      you translate the text in the labels and buttons into other
      languages they may not fit.
     </para>
    
   </sect2> 

   <sect2><title>
     How do I change the colors of a widget, e.g. make a label red?
    </title>
    
     <para>
In GTK+ 2 there are new convenience functions to change some of the style
properties of a widget, e.g. you can use gtk_widget_modify_fg() to set the
foreground color of a widget.
     </para>
     <para>
It is also possible to use GTK+ rc files to set the colors &amp; fonts of
your widgets.
If you turn on the 'Set Widget Names' project option in Glade, that may make
it easier to refer to your widgets, as you can refer to them by name.
See the GTK+ Resource Files documentation at <ulink
url="http://developer.gnome.org/doc/API/gtk/index.html"
type="http">developer.gnome.org/doc/API/gtk/index.html</ulink>. 
     </para>
     <para>
You can also change a widget's style within your code by calling
gtk_widget_modify_style(), e.g.
      <programlisting>
  GdkColor red = { 0, 65535, 0, 0 };
  GtkRcStyle *rc_style = gtk_rc_style_new ();
  rc_style->fg[GTK_STATE_NORMAL] = red;
  rc_style->color_flags[GTK_STATE_NORMAL] |= GTK_RC_FG;
  gtk_widget_modify_style (widget, rc_style);
  gtk_rc_style_unref (rc_style);
      </programlisting>
     </para>
    
   </sect2> 

   <sect2><title>
      How do I add a pixmap to a button?
    </title>
    
     <para>
      Create a button and select <guilabel>Remove Label</guilabel>
      from the popup menu. You can then add any widgets you like to
      the button, e.g. a horizontal box with a pixmap and a label
      inside it. (<application>Glade</application> may make this even
      easier in future.)
     </para>
    
   </sect2> 

   <sect2><title>
      How do I add several widgets of the same type in one go?
    </title>
    
     <para>
      Hold the 'Control' key when you select the widget in the
      <interface>Palette</interface>. It will then stay selected until
      you select another widget or the
      <interface>Selector</interface>. 
     </para>
    
   </sect2> 

   <sect2><title>
      I get this warning whenever I use a scrolled window:
      Gtk-WARNING **: <errorname>gtk_scrolled_window_add(): cannot add
      non scrollable widget use
      gtk_scrolled_window_add_with_viewport() instead</errorname>
    </title>
    
     <para>
      You can safely ignore this warning. It is output by GTK+ to
      remind people to update their code, since the behaviour of
      scrolled windows changed quite a bit between GTK+ 1.0 and GTK+
      1.2. But the <application>Glade</application> code is OK. The
      warning should not appear in your final application.
     </para>
    
   </sect2> 

   <sect2><title>
     What graphics formats does Glade support?
    </title>
    
     <para>
GTK+ 2.0 includes the gdk-pixbuf library which provides support for many
graphics formats, including PNG, TIFF, BMP, JPEG and XPM files.
     </para>
     <para>
You can convert images between formats using the GIMP graphics
application or the 'convert' utility in the ImageMagick toolkit.
     </para>
    
   </sect2> 

   <sect2><title>
     How do I add a signal handler?
    </title>
    
     <para>
Follow these steps:
     <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
       <para>
Select the widget you want to add the handler to.
       </para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
       <para>
Select the 'Signals' page in the Property Editor window.
       </para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
       <para>
Click the '...' button to the right of the 'Signal:' field. This should
 show a popup window listing the signals that this widget emits.
       </para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
       <para>
In the popup window, select which signal you want to connect a handler for
 and hit the 'OK' button.
       </para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
       <para>
Glade automatically creates a name for the signal handler function in the
 'Handler:' field, but you are free to change this if you desire.
       </para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
       <para>
Click the 'Add' button to add it to the list of signal handlers for this
 widget.
     </para>
      </listitem>
     </itemizedlist>
    </para>
     <para>
When you generate the C source code, an empty signal handler function should
be output in the callbacks.c file. You can add your code to this function.
     </para>
    
   </sect2>

      How do I build the code generated by Glade?

     <para>
      You need <application>automake</application> >= 1.4 &amp;
      <application>autoconf</application> >= 2.52 to build the generated
      C code. You also need <application>gettext</application> >=
      0.10.40 if you enabled <application>gettext</application>
      support. See the <citetitle>Requirements</citetitle> section in
      the <filename>README</filename> file for links to these.
     </para>
     <para>
      Run <command>./autogen.sh</command> in the toplevel directory of
      the project to run <application>automake</application>,
      <application>autoconf</application> and the related utilities to
      build the <filename>Makefile</filename>'s. Pass it any options
      you want passed to configure, e.g. <command>./autogen.sh
      --prefix /usr/local/gnome</command>.
     </para>
     <para>
      Then run <command>make</command> to build your application.
     </para>
     <para>
      You you must also do a <command>make install</command>  so that the
      pixmaps are
      installed properly. If you don't do that, it will still run, but
      you won't see the pixmaps.
     </para>
    
   </sect2>

      I get this error:
      aclocal: configure.in: 10: <errorname>macro `AM_PATH_GTK' not
      found in library</errorname>
    </title>
    
     <para>
      This means that the <filename>gtk.m4</filename> file cannot be
      found. (<filename>gtk.m4</filename> is a set of m4 macros which
      is installed as part of GTK+ and is used to build programs
      which use GTK+.) <application>aclocal</application> (part of
      <application>automake</application>) searches for these macros
      to add to <filename>aclocal.m4</filename> in your program's root
      directory.
     </para>
     <para>
      To find out whereabouts GTK+ is installed, run
      <command>pkg-config --cflags gtk+-2.0</command>.
      The <filename>gtk.m4</filename> file should
      be in the <filename class="directory">share/aclocal</filename>
      subdirectory rather than the
      <filename class="directory">include</filename> subdirectory.
      To find out the directory that
      <application>aclocal</application> is using, run
      <command>aclocal --print-ac-dir</command>. 
     </para>
     <para>
      You should add the directory that the GTK+ m4 file is installed
      to the <varname>ACLOCAL_FLAGS</varname> environment variable,
      e.g. if the GTK+ m4 files are in <filename
      class="directory">/usr/local/share/aclocal</filename>, then add
      this to your <filename>$HOME/.profile</filename>:
      <command>export ACLOCAL_FLAGS="-I
      /usr/local/share/aclocal/"</command>.
     </para>

	You are trying to use Gnome stock menu items in a GTK+-only app.
    Edit any menus you have and make sure the "Stock" property is set to

This shouldn't happen in the new version of Glade, as it prevents you from

       <title>Changing the GNOME and Gettext Support Options</title>
       <para>
        If you change the <guilabel>Gnome Support</guilabel> or
        <guilabel>Gettext Support</guilabel> project  options after
        building the project, you will need to update some of the
        build files such as <filename>configure.in</filename> and
        <filename>Makefile.am</filename>. The best solution may be to
        change the project directory in the <interface>Project
        Options</interface> dialog, and to rebuild the project from
        scratch. However, you would have to copy over any code you
        have added to signal handlers. An alternative would be to
        delete <filename>autogen.sh</filename>,
        <filename>configure.in</filename>,
        <filename>Makefile.am</filename>,
        <filename>src/Makefile.am</filename>, and
        <filename>src/main.c</filename> and use
        <application>Glade</application>  to recreate them. But if you
        have changed these files you will need to add the changes back
        in.  (Hopefully <application>Glade</application> will deal
        with this better in future.)

      What files can the developer edit safely and which files are
      overwritten? 
    </title>
    
     <para>
      <application>Glade</application> will not overwrite most of the
      files. It will recreate the build files if they don't exist (and
      the corresponding project option is set.)
     </para>
     <para>
      The files which <application>Glade</application> overwrites are:
      <filename>interface.h</filename>,
      <filename>interface.c</filename>, 
      <filename>support.h</filename>, and
      <filename>support.c</filename>.
      (Though you may have named them differently in your project, if
      you changed them in the <interface>Project Options</interface>
      dialog.)

     <para>
      These files all have a warning at the top saying <quote>DO NOT
      EDIT</quote>.
     </para>
     <para>
      If you have added or updated any signal handlers, then these are
      appended to the <filename>callbacks.h</filename> and
      <filename>callbacks.c</filename> files. So any code you have
      already added for callbacks is completely safe! If you have
      renamed a handler function then it is up to you to remove the
      old version and copy any code to the new function.

     How do I add a library to the project?
    </title>
    
     <para>
You need to add a test for the library in your project's configure.in file,
making sure that the CPPFLAGS and LIBS are updated to account for the library.
(The CPPFLAGS variable should contain any -I flags to pass to the C
preprocessor, and the LIBS variable should contain the -l and -L options to
pass to the linker.)
     </para>
     <para>
autoconf provides macros such as AC_CHECK_HEADER and AC_CHECK_LIB which can
be used to check for general headers and libraries.
     </para>
     <para>
Many GTK+ and Gnome libraries provide a config script such as gtk-config
which will output the CPPFLAGS and LIBS flags needed.
     </para>
     <para>
For example, libxml provides an xml-config script which you can use like this:
      <programlisting>
  dnl Get libxml flags &amp; libs
  AC_PATH_PROG(xml_config, xml-config)
  if test "x$xml_config" = "x"; then
    AC_MSG_ERROR([*** xml-config not found.])
  fi

  XML_CFLAGS=`$xml_config --cflags 2>/dev/null`
  XML_LIBS=`$xml_config --libs 2>/dev/null`
  CPPFLAGS="$CPPFLAGS $XML_CFLAGS"
  LIBS="$LIBS $XML_LIBS"
      </programlisting>
     </para>
     <para>
Make sure you place your configure.in test before the call to AC_OUTPUT.

      How do I get a pointer to a widget from within a signal handler?

     <para>
      Use the <function>lookup_widget</function>() function
      provided. (It can be found in <filename>support.c</filename>.)
     </para>
     <para>
      You pass it a pointer to any widget in a window, and the name of
      the widget that you want to get. Usually in signal handlers you
      can use the first argument to the signal handler as the first
      parameter to <function>lookup_widget</function>(), e.g. 
      <programlisting>
void
on_button1_clicked                     (GtkButton       *button,
                                        gpointer         user_data)
{
  GtkWidget *entry1;

  entry1 = lookup_widget (GTK_WIDGET (button), "entry1");

  ...
}
      </programlisting>
     </para>
     <para>
      Note that this does not work if you are using libglade. The corresponding
      code for libglade would be:
      <programlisting>

void
on_button1_clicked                     (GtkButton       *button,
                                        gpointer         user_data)
{
  GladeXML* xml;
  GtkWidget* entry1;

  xml = glade_get_widget_tree (GTK_WIDGET (button1));
  entry1 = glade_xml_get_widget (xml, "entry1");

  ...

     How do I get a pointer to a widget in another window?
    </title>
    
     <para>
You need to keep track of pointers to all your toplevel windows.
For simple applications you can just use global variables to store these
pointers.
     </para>
     <para>
For more complicated applications you can use
<function>gtk_object_set_data</function>() and the
related functions to store a pointer to one window inside another window.
For example, if you want to create a dialog which needs to access widgets in
the main window you can do this:
      <programlisting>
  dialog = create_dialog1 ();  /* Call the function generated by Glade. */
  gtk_object_set_data (GTK_OBJECT (dialog), "main_window", main_window);
      </programlisting>
Then when you need to access the main window from within the dialog code,
you can do this:
      <programlisting>
  main_window = gtk_object_get_data (GTK_OBJECT (dialog), "main_window");
      </programlisting>
     </para>
     <para>
You need to be careful to ensure that the pointer is always valid.
If the window being pointed to is destroyed, make sure you no longer use the
pointer to it or your application may crash.

      How do I get the value of a GtkOptionMenu?

     <para>
      Call <function>gtk_menu_get_active</function>() with the
      GtkOptionMenu's menu to get the currently selected menu
      item. You can use <function>g_list_index</function>() to find
      its index in the menu:
      <programlisting>
void
on_button1_clicked                     (GtkButton       *button,
                                        gpointer         user_data)
{
  GtkWidget *option_menu, *menu, *active_item;
  gint active_index;

  option_menu = lookup_widget (GTK_WIDGET (button), "optionmenu1");
  menu = GTK_OPTION_MENU (option_menu)->menu;
  active_item = gtk_menu_get_active (GTK_MENU (menu));
  active_index = g_list_index (GTK_MENU_SHELL (menu)->children, active_item);

  g_print ("Active index: %i\n", active_index);
}</programlisting>

     <para>
      When you create the window, get the option menu and connect to
      the <quote>deactivate</quote> signal emitted by its menu:
      <programlisting>
  window1 = create_window1 ();
  option_menu = lookup_widget (window1, "optionmenu1");
  gtk_signal_connect (GTK_OBJECT (GTK_OPTION_MENU (option_menu)->menu),

                      NULL);</programlisting>
     </para>

     <para>
      Then add a handler to <filename>callbacks.c</filename>. You can
      get the index of the selected item just like the previous answer:

static void

     How do I add rows to a GtkCList before the window is shown?

     <para>
After you create the window, using the 'create' function generated by Glade,
use <function>lookup_widget</function>() to get a pointer to the GtkCList
widget, and add the rows as required. e.g.
      <programlisting>
  GtkWidget *window, *clist;
  gchar *row[2];		/* Our GtkCList only has 2 columns. */

  window = create_window1 ();
  clist = lookup_widget (window, "clist1");

  row[0] = "Hello";
  row[1] = "World";
  gtk_clist_append (GTK_CLIST (clist), row);

  row[0] = "Second";
  row[1] = "Row";
  gtk_clist_append (GTK_CLIST (clist), row);

  gtk_widget_show (window1);
