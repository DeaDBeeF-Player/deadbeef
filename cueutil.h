// Load cuesheet, find the corresponding audiofiles, and add them as tracks into playlist, if they can be found.
//
// If namelist is not NULL (result of scandir), it helps to find the audio files in the cuesheet directory,
// and allows to mark them as used to avoid adding the same files multiple times.
//
// Internally, the function finds and loads the cue file, and passes it to `plt_load_cuesheet_from_buffer`, see below for more information.
//
// Argument breakdown:
//  `playlist` where to add files.
//  The item `after` which to insert the files. NULL means beginning of playlist.
//  `fullname` is the fully qualified path to the cuesheet file.
//  `dirname` is full directory path, in which scandir was performed.
//  `namelist` and `n` is the scandir output.
//  The `dirname`, `namelist` and `n` can be either all set to NULL, otherwise they all must be valid values.

// This is a more internal function, to load cuesheet from buffer.
// Semantics are the same as `plt_load_cue_file`.
//
// Additional arguments:
//  `fname`: the file from which the cuesheet was loaded, either the cue file itself, or its audio file.
//  `embedded_origin`: the track from which the embedded cuesheet was extracted.
//  `embedded_numsamples`: number of samples in the whole track.
//  `embedded_samplerate`: samplerate of the track.
//  `buffer`: pointer to the string containing cuesheet.
//  `buffersize`: size of the buffer.
